									<p>It should not be a surprise to people who know me that a large number of my projects are video games related. 
										Whether it is about beating a hard game, grinding a competive game to the highest rank, or simply playing for fun with friends, video game get a non negligeable part of my time.
										For more than 15 years now I've been tempering with games by trying do remove defaults. 
										I won't detailed in depth years of modding Pokémon games to my liking, which are, in the end, small projects.
										I did went through some failed RPG and Rogue Lite project on Unreal Engine 4 and 5, respectively. 
										These were mainly due to being one person projects, and the motivation went lacking after few months (although I am not shutting the door on the rogue lite project yet).
										Nevertheless, my two biggest game development projects are also the two most ambitious and well managed. one of them was developed until completion (From 1 AU), and the second is Pokémon Fan Game that is still under development but in a good shape.
										Thus, I will mainly discuss these two projects in their respective pages.
									  </p>

									<p>
										An amazing thing happened when you first learn to code: you feel you can solve everything with an algorythm. This is true for the most part: if I can simulate a black hole accretion disk then how wrong can it be?
										So from time to time, I tend to have weird ideas such as "Could I code this or that? Could I beat this game without playing? Neural Network sounds fun, right?". If most of my attempts were not quite as succesful as I hoped, I still had some sucess.
										Unfortunatly, most of my code are lost between dead computers and fried hard drives. However, I did found back a code from 2020 worth mentionning. 
										This code beats (I would even say "crushes" as it shattered my personal record in 6 attempts) a mobile game called "2048" and I will discuss it in a dedicated page.
									</p>

									<p>
										Finally, I am always in for crafting and design activities. I do not have much drawing skills but I always have ideas. 
										I could talk about a virous load of small/medium projects going from re designing flats, small craft in the house, to even repainting and redesigning the family windsurf equipment trailer. 
										However, here I will talk about some personnal project that I am particulary proud of: the painting and assembling of a Bass Guitar, and the carving of Rudius.
