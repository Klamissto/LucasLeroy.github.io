									<p>From 1 AU is a UI based Space game, largely based on the open-source browser game <a href="https://lobby.ogame.gameforge.com/fr_FR/">"Ogame"</a>.
										It also use few gameplay features from "SpaceWar" (another broser game similar to Ogame) and some assets from the 4X <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/stellaris/about">"Stellaris"</a> by Paradox Interactive.</p>
										<p>The goal of the game is to develope you civilisation, expand it from your home world by colonizing. To this end you can simply farm ressources on your worlds, fight other empires for ressources and galactic control, or explore the galaxy.
											The particularity of From 1 AU is that it's game played in real time, meaning that the game keep advancing while your game application is off. 
											This game is meant to be played a for a few minute every days.
									 		It is a solo player game in its v1.0 (although a multiplayer was discussed as part of later uptdates).
										</p>
										<p>The main idea behind this project was to develope an "Ogame 2.0" by removing most of the features that negatively impact the player experience: the monetization and the fear of losing your progress overnight.
									 While developing, we took the liberty to add few features to improve the game such as new buildings, ships, defenses and technologies; a late game challenge (the Kardachev scale); and a system of quest, reward, empire personalization (the Guilds system). </p>
									 <p>The game was developed from scratch on Unreal Engine 4 by a team of 2 people over a year in 2021. We stop the development at version 1.0.5 (v1.0 and 5 bug patches). At this point the game is fully playable in french and english, and ready for distribution.</p>
									<p>Disclamer: This game project was never commercialised or distributed; and was for the personnal use of their developpers only.</p>

							<p>In this section, I will go through features that were already in some way or another in "Ogame" that we reimplemented directly or tweaked to reach our visions.</p>

							<header id="removingthemonetization" class="style1">
								<h2>Removing the Monetization</h2>
							</header>
							<p>"Ogame" is heavily monetized and the purpose of it is to give a competitive advantage to the player through extra ressources or perks. 
								If we wished to get rid of this aspect, some of the perks that arise from the monetization are actully great gameplay feature that westill wanted in the game.
								Thus, we tried to incorporate them in the base game in the way that makes sense.
							</p>

							<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Antimatter.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p> The antimater is the ressource of monetization a player could buy to get advantages. 
								Instead of removing it altogether we just to keep it and introduce it as a rare late-game ressource that the player can unclock and farm on his worlds.
								For this purpose we added a farm and storage building: the Particule Accelerator and Antimatter Tank, respectively.</p>

							<p>This way, most the Merchant features (Ressource Market, Scrap Merchant and Import/Export), and the Shop could be kept as in the original game; providing few balancing changes.</p>



							<header id="remplacingplayersbybots" class="style1">
								<h2>Remplacing Players by Bots</h2>
							</header>
							<p>"Ogame" is a multiplayer first, and the interactions between players (wars, guilds, cooperations) are a big part of the game. 
								On the other hand, the fact that another player can totally wipe out your whole fleet while you sleep is a bit overwhealming for casual players.
								Thus we decied to remove this PvP altogether and making it a solo game. </p>

							<p>The bots were proceduraly generated, along the universe itself, to resemble a distriution that could be observe in a mature "Ogame" universe. 
								The main lines of this process was to generate a distribution of bots General Points.
								Then deduce from it specificities of the empire and associate planets (spread in system close to a "home" planet), fleets (with a scatter depending on an indicator of their agressivness), building, and technologies levels.
								All of these were, of course, did in a way it did not break the technology tree of the game.</p>

							<p>The name of each empire was randomly generated as well by associating an empire title among 20 (Empire, Union, Federation, Concil...) with the specie's name of the empire. 
								The specie's name was determined by randomly putting together syllable in a large set. Then a specie sprite was associated with the empire.</p>

								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/BotsIMG.png" alt="" /></a>

							<p>Our main goal for a v2.0 would have been to bring the cooperation back by making it a multiplayer cooperative game again, or at least to add more cooperative features with the bots such as trades and alliances.
							</p>

							<header id="aproceduralygenerateduniverse" class="style1">
								<h2>A Proceduraly Generated Universe</h2>
							</header>
							<a  class="image left"><img src="images/UniverseParam.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>The game universe is proceduraly generated at the start of a new game according to a set of adjustable parameters.</p>
							
							<p>For example the player can chose the number of galaxies, and the number of system per galaxy. 
								Picking a too high number can however lead to a higher loading time when logging back in a game (that is when al the uptdate of what happened when the player was away takes place).</p>
							
							<p>The player can also chose his home planet. In the game not all planet are equal: some gives you more of one kind of ressources, others are smaller/larger than average. 
								This option can give the player a different taste to a new game; picking a planet in position 1 (the closest to the star) or 15 (on the edges of the systeme) could be quite challenging.</p>
							
							<p>The game is quite slow in its default settings: count roughly 4-6 months to reach the late game, and over a year to climb to rank 1 of the galaxy. 
								Thus, we added the possibility for the player to change the speed of the game in case he wishes to develop faster (such as in the SpaceWars browser game were these kind of paramaters are turn all the way up).</p>

							<p>Then, we added an option in a "Other Bonus" so the player can tweak his experience to his liking. This section was in particular meant to be fill in later updates of the game.</p>

							<header id="thelocalisation" class="style1">
								<h2>The Localisation</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The game was developped for French and English speaker, and the language can be changed in game at any time.</p>
							<p>Fun fact: I re-implemented a localisation system from scratch for this game, and I learned few months after the end of the project that Unreal Engine has, obviously, a pre-implemented localisation sytem easy (and easier) to use.</p>

								<p>In this section, I will go through features that were added and that were not in "Ogame".</p>
								<p>guilds system, new ships, new defenses, new building, new technologies, marché galactic, auctioneer, combat simulator, login summary, quality of life</p>
								<header id="thediplomacy" class="style1">
									<h2>The Diplomacy</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In a way to make up for the removal of the multiplayer, we implemented a simple diplomacy system. In v1.0, it is pretty basic and only deal with negative relation between empires and the player.
									This, however, allows to make the universe a bit more realistic in a way that your act won't go unoticed and the player can't just attack other empires without them fighting back.
									In case the player spy too many times or attack a rival empire, the later will fight back and regulary send fleets to attck and probe to spy the player's worlds.
								</p>
								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/Diplomacy.png" alt="" /></a>

								<p>
									The frequency of an empires actions are pretty much determined by the level of the relationship: being the slight rival might just lead to few probing mission and occasionnal attacks once in a while; on the other hand draging a relationship to the sewer will lead to daily attacks.
									The strenght of the fleet depends mainly on the Military Points of the attacking empires. In a way to add variety to the fleet send we created a pool of fleet with differents ship distribution: some will be more deadly against defenses, others against certain kind of ships...
								</p>

								<p>
									The player will always have the opportunity to make peace with an attcker if he wishes to and has the require ressources to pay the tribute required by the ennemy empire. The tribute scale with the level of the relationship and the player points.
									A player can also decide to declare war to an empire if he wishes so.
								</p>


								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Diplomacy2.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									in a way to avoid, the player to take advantage of the game by declearing war to all weak empire whho will then crash their fleet on the player's wolrds, we added a security. 
									In case the player is significativly stronger compare to another empire, this empire will appear as dead and will no longer attack the player with his fleets.
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>

								<header id="thekardachevscale" class="style1">
									<h2>The Kardachev Scale</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The Kardachev Scale is the game given to the post-game in From 1 AU.
									The name comes from the real Kardachev scale theorised by Nikolai Kardashev in the 1960s (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">learn more</a>).
									The essence of it is that there is different kind of civilization operating on different levels of energy. In From 1 AU, this is an option that become available when the player reach the rank 1 of his universe.
									It will, if chosen by the player, clear the universe and fill it with stronger empires that belong to the next Kardachev scale.
									The player can thus go on pretty much indefinitly on a single play through by grinding every Kardachev scales.
									We put this in place to always give the player a challenging environment even if he wishes to pursue his playthrough beyond reaching rank 1 in his first universe.
								</p>

								<header id="theempirewindow" class="style1">
									<h2>The Empire Window</h2>
								</header>

								<p>The Empire window is a feature that was already in the SpaceWar browser game. 
								It is meant to help the player keep track of everything that is going on in your empire as it could start to e overwhealming once the player gets several worlds to manage.
								</p>

								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/EmpireWindow.gif" alt="" /></a>

								<p>In From 1 AU, we try to reproduce this approach by recreating an more polish Empire window to give access to all the details the player could use.
									In the v1.0, the Empire window include detail on current ressources ("Ressources"); ressource production ("Production"); building and research queues ("Being Built"), available fleets and defenses ("Fleets"), built buildings ("Buildings"), and relationships with other empires ("Relationships").
								</p>

								
								<p>As part of From 1 AU, the Empire View is unlocked via the Guilds System, by following the Architects Guild path.</p>

								<header id="thecombatsimulator" class="style1">
									<h2>The Combat Simulator</h2>
								</header>

								<p>A by part of From 1 AU gameplay is about attacking ennemy empires of defending your world, the upcoming victory or defeat could be hard to predict for player as many factors impact the outcome (i.e. fleets involves, rapidfires, technologies...).
									This feature was not included in "Ogame" but is actully crucial for every player that whishes to make good decisioins constistently. Thus we decided to included as part of the game into a user friendly window.
								</p>

								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/CombatSimulator.gif" alt="" /></a>

								<p>Since there is a part of randomness in the battle of From 1 AU (due to the rapidfires), the Combat Simulator will not be able to predict the peculiar outcom of your next battle.
									However, provided all the required informations, it will be able to simulate your upcoming battle multiple times and give the most probable mean outcome with details on how much fleets will be lost, chance of winning, debris fields... 
								</p>

								<p>As part of From 1 AU, the Empire View is unlocked via the Guilds System, by following the Military Guild path.</p>

						<article class="box post">
							<p>This game did not require many art to be made as most of it was re-used: most of the UI was taken from "Ogame", all the music and Species sprites from "Stellaris". 
								However, we still needed few UI elements for incorporating the new features such as the Guilds system and the Species Page. 
								All the new pages that were not originally in "Ogame", such as the Empire window and the research tab, were drawn and expanded from the style of the rest of game so there is very little creation on this part.</p>
							
								<header id="theguildssytemuiicons" class="style1">
									<h2>The Guilds sytem UI icons</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>The purpose of these 6 icons is to help the player to identify the Corresponding guild through a color and a sign.</p>

								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/GuildsUI_Icon.png" alt="" /></a>

									<h2>The Diplomacy UI</h2>
								</header>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/DiplomacyUI.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The purpose of this UI is to help the player to get a grasp on the level of the relationship with other empires. 
									It also allows to make peace (reset the relationship to 0) of declare war (the empire will then be aggressive toward the player). </p>
