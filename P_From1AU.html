									<p>From 1 AU is a UI based Space game, largely based on the open-source browser game <a href="https://lobby.ogame.gameforge.com/fr_FR/">"Ogame"</a>.
										It also uses some gameplay elements from "SpaceWar" (another broser game similar to Ogame) and some assets from 4X. <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/stellaris/about">"Stellaris"</a> by Paradox Interactive.
									</p>
									<p>The aim of the game is to develop your civilisation and expand beyond your home world through colonisation. 
										To do this, you can simply grow resources on your worlds, fight other empires for resources and galactic control, or explore the galaxy.
										What's special about From 1 AU is that it's a real-time game, meaning that the game continues to progress while your game application is turned off. 
										This game is designed to be played for a few minutes a day, every days.
										This is a single-player game in its 1.0 version (although multiplayer has been envisaged as part of subsequent updates).
									</p>
									<p>
										The main idea behind this project was to develop an "Ogame 2.0" by removing most of the elements that have a negative impact on the player's experience: monetisation and the fear of losing progress overnight.
										During development, we took the liberty of adding a few features to improve the game, such as new buildings, ships, defences and technologies; an end-game challenge (The Kardachev scale); and a quest, reward and empire customisation system (the Guilds system). 
									</p>
									 <p>
										The game was developed from scratch on Unreal Engine 4 by a team of 2 people over the course of a year, from March 2021 to March 2022. 
										We have stopped development at version 1.0.5 (v1.0 and 5 bug fixes). At this stage, the game is fully playable in French and English.
									</p>
									<p>Disclaimer: This game project has never been commercialised or distributed; it is for the personal use of its developers.</p>

							<p>In this section, I will go through features that were already in some way or another in "Ogame" that we reimplemented directly or tweaked to reach our visions.</p>
							<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
							<header id="removingthemonetization" class="style1">
								<h2>Removing Monetisation</h2>
							</header>
							<p>"Ogame" is heavily monetized and the purpose of it is to give a competitive advantage to the player through extra ressources or perks. 
								If we wanted to get rid of that aspect, some of the perks that come from monetisation are actually great gameplay features that we still want to keep in the game.
								Thus, we tried to integrate them into the basic game as logically as possible.
							</p>

							<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/Antimatter.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p> 
								Antimatter is the monetisation resource that a player can buy to gain advantages.  
								Instead of removing it altogether, we've kept it and introduced it as a rare end-game resource that players can unlock and farm on their worlds.
								To this end, we have added a farm and a storage building: the Particle Accelerator and the Antimatter Tank, respectively.
							</p>

							<p>
								This way, most the Merchant features (Ressource Market, Scrap Merchant and Import/Export), and the Shop could be kept as in the original game; providing few balancing changes.
								The officers feature, were given their own building to be unlocked, and can now be upgraded afterward troughout the same system as technologies.
							</p>

							<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
							<header id="replacingplayerswithbots" class="style1">
								<h2>Replacing Players with Bots</h2>
							</header>
							<p>"Ogame" is first and foremost a multiplayer game, and interactions between players (wars, guilds, co-operations) are a big part of the game. 
								On the other hand, the fact that another player can wipe out your entire fleet while you're sleeping is a little exasperating for casual gamers.
								Thus we decied to remove the PvP altogether and make it a single-player game.
							</p>

							<p>
								The bots have been procedurally generated, as has the universe itself, to resemble a cast that might be seen in a mature "Ogame" universe.
								The main lines of this process were to generate a distribution of bots' General Points.
								Then deduce the empire's specific characteristics and associate planets (spread throughout the system close to a "home" planet), fleets (with dispersion depending on an indicator of their aggressiveness), buildings and technologies levels.
								All this has been done, of course, in such a way as not to break the game's technological tree.</p>

							<p>
								The name of each empire has also been randomly generated by associating one of 20 empire titles (Empire, Union, Federation, Concil...) with the name of the empire's species. 
								The species name was determined by randomly assembling syllables from a large set. Then a sprite of the species was associated with the empire.
							</p>

								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/From1AU/BotsIMG.png" alt="" /></a>

							<p>
								Our main objective for v2.0 would have been to bring back cooperation by making it a cooperative multiplayer game, or at least to add more cooperative functions with the bots such as trading and alliances.
							</p>

							<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
							<header id="aprocedurallygenerateduniverse" class="style1">
								<h2>A Procedurally Generated Universe</h2>
							</header>
							<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/UniverseParam.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>The game universe is procedurally generated at the start of a new game based on a set of adjustable parameters.</p>
							
							<p>For example, the player can choose the number of galaxies and the number of systems per galaxy. 
								However, choosing too high a number may result in a longer loading time when the player reconnects to a game (this is when the update of what happened during the player's absence takes place).</p>
							
							<p>Players can also choose their home planet. In the game, not all planets are equal: some give you more/less of some specific resource, others might be smaller/larger. 
								This option can give players a different taste for a new game; choosing a planet in position 1 (closest to the star) or 15 (on the edges of the system) can be a real challenge.</p>
							
							<p>The game is fairly slow in its default settings: allow around 4 to 6 months to reach the end of the game, and more than a year to climb to rank 1 in the galaxy. 
								So we've added the option for players to change the speed of the game if they want to progress more quickly (as in the browser game SpaceWars, where this type of setting is turned all the way up).</p>

							<p>Then, we've added an option in an "Other Bonus" section so that players can tailor their experience to their taste. This section was intended to be filled in future updates to the game.</p>

							<header id="thelocalization" class="style1">
								<h2>The Localization</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The game has been developed for both French and English speakers, and the language can be changed at any time in the game.</p>
							<p>Fun fact: I reimplemented a localization system from scratch for this game, and learned a few months after the project was completed that Unreal Engine 4 does, of course, have an easy (and easier) pre-implemented localization system to use.</p>

								<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
								<header id="theguildsystem" class="style1">
									<h2>The Guild System</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The guild system is probably the most important addition we have made. 
									It provides the player with a set of objectives to achieve within 6 guilds: The Collectors Guild, The Traders Guild, The Architects Guild, The Explorators Guild, The Defenders Guild and The Warriors Guild. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Players can progress each guild by completing specific tasks:
									mainly by collecting resources for The Collectors Guild,
									by trading and transporting resources for The Traders Guilds,
									by building facilities for the Architects Guild,
									by conducting research and expeditions for the Explorators Guild,
									by building defences and winning defensive battles for The Defenders Guild,
									by building fleets and winning offensive battles for The Warriors Guild.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each guild has 20 levels, each with its own requirements and rewards. 
									By grinding a guild, players will be able to unlock key buildings, technologies, ships and defences, as well as obtaining various bonuses that will enhance each guild's style of play.

								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
								<header id="diplomacy" class="style1">
									<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
								</header>
								<p>To compensate for the loss of multiplayer, we have introduced a simple diplomacy system. 
									In v1.0, it is fairly basic and only deals with negative relationships between empires and the player.
									This does, however, make the world a little more realistic, in that your actions will not go unnoticed and the player will not be able to attack other empires without them retaliating.
									If the player spies too often or attacks a rival empire, the latter will retaliate and regularly send fleets to attack and probe the player's worlds.
								</p>
								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/From1AU/Diplomacy.png" alt="" /></a>

								<p>
									The frequency of an empire's actions is largely determined by the level of the relationship: being a small rival may lead to a few espionage missions and occasional attacks from time to time; on the other hand, having a relationship down to -100 will lead to daily attacks.
									The power of the fleet sent depends mainly on the military points of the attacking empires. 
									To vary the fleets sent out by enemy empires, we have created a pool of fleets with a different distribution of ships: some will be more lethal against defences, others against certain types of ship...
								</p>

								<p>
									Players will always have the option of making peace with an enemy if they so wish and if they have the resources to pay the tribute demanded by the enemy empire. 
									The fee varies according to the level of the relationship and the player's points.
									A player can also decide to declare war on an empire if he wishes.
								</p>

								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/Diplomacy2.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									To prevent the player from taking advantage of the game by declaring war on all the weak empires, which will then crush their fleets on the player's worlds, we've added a security feature. 
									If the player is significantly stronger than another empire, that empire will appear dead and will no longer attack the player with its fleets.
									It also gives players another way out of the war: outclassing their opponents by destroying their fleets and defences, which has the effect of lowering their point total.

								<header id="theempirewindow" class="style1">
									<h2>The Empire Window</h2>
								</header>

								<p>The Empire window is a feature that already existed in the SpaceWar browser game. 
									It is designed to help players keep track of everything that is going on in their empire, as it could become overwhelming once they have several worlds to manage.
								</p>
								
								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/From1AU/EmpireWindow.gif" alt="" /></a>

								<p>In From 1 AU, we tried to reproduce this approach by recreating a more polished Empire window to give access to all the details that the player could use.
									In version 1.0, the Empire window contains information on current resources ("Resources"), resource production ("Production"), construction and research queues ("Being Built"), available fleets and defences ("Fleets"), buildings constructed ("Buildings") and relationships with other empires ("Relationships").
								</p>

								
								<p>As part of From 1 AU, the Empire view is unlocked via the guild system, by following the path of the Architects Guild path.</p>

									<h2>New Buildings, Fleets and Technologies</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In From 1 AU, we have added several new buildings, fleets/defences and technologies to enhance the player experience. 
									Our aim was to enrich the game and not simply add new "recoloured" features.
									Thus, all the additions serve a unique and new purpose in the game.
									In this section, I will take a quick look at each of them.</p>
								<header class="style2">
									<h1>New Buildings and Facilities</h1>

								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/marche_intergalactique_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Intergalactic Market is the facility used to unlock the game's various merchants.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/centre_de_formation_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Training Center is the installation used to unlock the game's various officers. </p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<header class="style2">
									<h1>New Fleets and Defenses</h1>
								</header>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/exctracteur_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Extractor is a ship that can be sent to an uninhabited planet to extract resources.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/foudroyeur_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Striker is a massive ship that uses antimatter as its main weapon.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/convoyeur_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Convoyer is a massive cargo ship that can carry up to 250,000 resource units (base value).</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								</header>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/protecteur_planetaire_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Planetary Shield is a gigantic defence shield that encompasses the entire planet.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/canon_antimatiere_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Antimatter Cannon is a massive orbital defence system that uses antimatter as its main weapon.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/canon_graviton_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Graviton Cannon is a massive orbital defence system that creates a graviton field to destroy the most massive ships.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<header class="style2">
									<h1>New building class: Orbital Buildings</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									In from 1 Au, we have added a new category of buildings: Orbital buildings. These massive installations are designed to be built in orbit of a planet at an advanced stage of the game.
									Most of them are improved versions of certain facilities already on the planet, and are there to cope with the end-game which tends (in 'Ogame') to drastically slow down the rate of improvement and construction of facilities/ships/technology.
									The special feature of orbital buildings is that they don't need space on the planet to be built: they are built in orbit of the planet. 
									However, this advantage is offset by their high resource costs.
									</p>

								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/orbital_solar_plant_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Orbital Solar Plant enables a massive amount of energy to be produced from space. </p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>

								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/chantier_spatial_orbital_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Orbital Shipyard unlocks massive ships (that could not be built on a planet, like a DeathStar) and orbital defences. 
									It also significantly reduces the construction time for all ships from this world (similar to the effect of the nanite factory for buildings and facilities).</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/labo_orbital_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Orbital Laboratories help unlock some of the most advanced technologies. 
									It also considerably reduces the research time for all technologies on the planet (in a similar way to the effect of the nanite factory for buildings and facilities).</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/habitat_orbital_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Orbital Habitat works like a terraformer, providing additional building space on the planet.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/porte_saut_orbital_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Orbital Jump Gate reduces the outbound travel time for the fleet departing from this planet.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/From1AU/lune_artificielle_small.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Artificial Moon allows players to build their own moon from resources. 
									Moons are quite valuale in From 1 AU and the only other way to create one is by random generation from a post-battle wreackage.
									Thus, we have decided to add an (extremely expensive) option for players to create their own moon, so that they won't be deprived of this part of the game indefinitely if they're unlucky. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<header class="style2">
									<h1>New Technologies</h1>
								</header>
								<p> We have also added 4 new (advanced) technologies to unlock some of the more advanced previously presented additions.
									These technologies include: the Orbital Engineering, Particle, Space Jump, and Quantum Technologies.

									In From 1 AU, an important part of the game is attacking enemy empires or defending your worlds. Victory or defeat can be difficult for the player to predict, as many factors influence the outcome (e.g. fleets involved, rapid fire, technologies, etc.).
									This function was not included in "Ogame", but it is crucial for all players who want to make good decisions at all times. 
									Thus, we decided to include it in the game in a user-friendly window.
								</p>

								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/From1AU/CombatSimulator.gif" alt="" /></a>

								<p>As there is an element of randomness in the From 1 AU battle (due to rapid fire), the combat simulator will not be able to predict the particular outcome of your next battle.
									However, provided it has all the necessary information, it will be able to simulate the upcoming battle several times and give the most likely average outcome, with details of the number of fleets lost, the chances of victory, the debris fields, etc. 
								</p>

								<p>As part of From 1 AU, the Combat Simulator is unlocked via the guild system, by following the path of the Warriors Guild path.</p>

									<h2>The Auctioneer Rework</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In "Ogame", the Auctioneer allows all players to take part in an auction for a perk. 
									With the other players out of the way, the Auctioneer feature would become very similar to the Import/Export feature.
									Thus, in From 1 AU, we have reworked the Auctioneer function so that the player can now buy one fleet per day (as in Import/Export, where the player can buy one perk per day).
								</p>
								<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/From1AU/Auctioneer.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The ships/defences available in the Auctioneer are drawn from a pool of predefined ship/defence distributions. 
									This allows the player to be presented with different types of fleets with different specialisations.
									Some are more focused on light/medium/heavy defences/ships, others on civil and utility fleets.
									The Auctioneer's aim is to enable players to buy instantly fleets at a lower price than if they were to build them directly in their shipyards.
									However, the trade off is that the player does not get to hand-pick the fleet he buys.
									The number of fleets/defences in a daily pack is determined by the player's General Points. 
									As a result, the feature is accessible and balanced throughout the whole playthrough.
								</p>
								<p>	
									As well as all the features that reset every day, it also increases player engagement and gives them another reason to log in every day.

									Now that the opportunity to do so has disappeared, we have reworked the Spaceport and given it a new purpose: to reduce the fuel cost of launching a fleet from a planet.
									This has the advantage of solving a major problem at the end of the game, namely the huge amount of deterium needed to move gigantic fleets.

									<h2>The Kardachev Scale</h2>

								<p>The Kardachev Scale is the name given to the post-game in From 1 AU.
									The name comes from the real Kardachev scale theorised by Nikolaï Kardachev in the 1960s (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">learn more</a>).
									The bottom line is that there are different types of civilisation operating at different energy levels. 
									In From 1 AU, this is an option that becomes available when the player reaches rank 1 in their universe.
									If chosen by the player, it will clear the universe and fill it with more powerful empires belonging to the next Kardachev scale.
									The player can therefore continue to play almost indefinitely on a single playthrough by completing all of Kardachev's scales.
									We have put this in place so that we can always offer players a stimulating environment, even if they want to continue their adventure beyond reaching rank 1 in their universe.

									Along the way, we have also made a number of improvements to the UI to help players navigate more quickly and assess the situation of their empire more easily. 
									I am sure I have forgotten some of them because, as I write this article, I have the impression that these features have always existed.
									However, these improvements include:
								</p>
								<p> - messages can be "asterisked" to prevent them being deleted over time.</p>
								<p> - quick access to "asterisked" messages.</p>
								<p> - options on how long it takes to delete a message after it has been viewed.</p>
								<p> - quick links from messages to various actions (sending a probe, colonisation ship, pre-filled combat simulator, etc.).</p>
								<p> - quick links between incoming/outgoing attacks and pre-filled combat simulator.</p>
								<p> - quick links to the various guilds.</p>
								<p> - redesign of the UI in the left-hand bar to include links to the new panels.</p>
								<p> - various information is displayed in the galaxy view (number of probes, recyclers and interplanetary missiles available).</p>
								<p> - a quick recycle button in the galaxy panel.</p>
								<p> - debris fields are added to the galaxy panel over time to bring the universe to life.</p>
								<p> - option to sort the player's planets on the right-hand side by coordinates, maximum space or date of colonisation.</p>
								<p> - quick save button (the game is saved automatically when you log in or out of the game, but although we have not reported any crashes in version 1.0, a manual save option is still useful).</p>
								<p> - option to change the player's name.</p>
								<p> - quick access to the player's rank in the ranks panel.</p>
								<p> - an indication of the number of fleets/defences the player can currently build.</p>
								<p> - and everything else I have forgotten...</p>

							<p>This game did not require much artistic work, as most of the elements were reused: most of the UI was taken from "Ogame", and all the music and species sprites from "Stellaris". 
								All the new pages that weren't originally in 'Ogame', such as the Empire window and the Research tree tab, have been designed and developed based on the style of the rest of the game, so there's very little creation on this side.

									We took the time to design a simple custom desktop logo for the game. 
									The logo is made up of an O star, a planet and a moon. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Fun fact: This model is not at all accurate from a scientific point of view.
									It is highly unlikely that an intelligent species could emerge naturally around an O star.

									From this logo, we also drew a simple title screen with the name of the game. 
									At the start of the project, we thought we were simply going to redo "Ogame".
									However, by the end of development, we had modified, added and tweaked so many features that we felt the game itself deserved its own name and logo.

						<article class="box post">
							<p>In the previous sections, I detailed everything we included in From 1 AU v1.0.
								We decided to stop development for two reasons: the first was that we had to stop at some point, and these features were the objective we had set ourselves a year earlier, and the second was that we really wanted to play the game. 
								That is why we decided to develop the game in the first place, and continuing to develop it would have delayed it even further, perhaps to the point where we would not want to play it any more.
							</p>
							<p>Nevertheless, we still had a lot of new features/improvements that we had written for a v2.0 of the game, which I'll quickly present here.</p>

							<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
							<header id="multiplayer" class="style1">
								<h2>Multiplayer</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The desire to restore the cooperative functions and multiplayer aspect of the game was there from the start. 
								The reason we decided to make From 1 AU a single-player game in version 1.0 is that we did not want to pay for a dedicated server to manage the universe in which players would play. 
								Given that this was our first major game development project, I still think it was a good decision, given all the unknowns about how the project would unfold at the time. </p>
							
							<p>The return of multiplayer was a first option, but we had already thought about improving the diplomacy system as such.
								For a later version, we wanted to put in place ways of improving relations with the AI empires. 
								The plan was for this to be achieved through small quests, trade and a system of emissaries.
								A positive relationship would have advantages such as reducing research time and allowing allies to be called upon during wars for ships or resources through a system of favours.
								Secondly, we wanted to re-establish alliances so that players could get even more bonuses through cooperation. 
								An alliance fleet shared by all participants and an alliance trading centre are just a few examples of what can be achieved.

							<header id="aspeciessystem" class="style1">
								<h2>A Species System</h2>
							</header>
							<p>In version 1.0 of From 1 AU, species are just a cosmetic feature. 
								Our future plan was to give each species small advantages that would encourage a different type of play.
								In fact, we've already written up the details of these bonuses for livability level, resource extraction and construction time during the v1.0 playtests.
								The aim was to give each species an identity with a preferred world type (meaning more available space) and innate skills (meaning various bonuses).
							</p>

							<p>
								We also developed an in-game modification system using a new 'biology' technology that would have allowed the player to modify the attributes of their species throughout the game.
								There has also been talk of being able to access specific species modifications through special side quests.
							</p>
							<p> 
								Of all the features planned for a v2.0, this is probably the most advanced, as its design is almost complete and it is ready for implementation.

							<header id="alesshomogenousuniverse" class="style1">
								<h2>A Less Homogenous Universe</h2>
							</header>

							<p>To make the universe less homogenous, we plan to create a more diverse set of systems. 
								For example, some might have fewer planets, a dead world, different types of stars (each with its own bonuses and habitable zone), a particular formation that brings modifiers to the system.
								We wanted to emphasise this sense of exploration, so that the player has the impression that the 'perfect solar system' is within their grasp.

							<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
							<header id="questsandstories" class="style1">
								<h2>Quests and Stories</h2>
							</header>

							<p>What do I mean by "quests" and "stories"? In "quests", the player receives a reward (resources, bonuses, fleet, building, technology, etc.), whereas in "stories", they don not (the story itself is the player's reward).</p>

							<p>For v2.0, we wanted to include a Main Quest line in which you must return an ancient advanced civilisation scattered across the universe. 
								The technology tree could have been modified to include the different stages of the story.</p>

							<p>On top of that, we wanted to include side quests that could have been quests of stories.
								This has been planned to encourage the player to explore the galaxy and make it less homogenous. 
								We would have added a scientific ship dedicated to planetary exploration. 
								The different solar systems could have been hidden from the player until they explored them.
								Some planets, chosen at random, would have a quest or story triggered during exploration that could lead to a reward (either resources, a ship or an exclusive bonus for the planet that would make it worthy of colonisation).
							</p>

							<p>
								Another way of adding a small secondary quest would have been to use the expedition system already in place, by adding new expedition outcomes.
								The new outcomes of the expedition would have required a decision from the player (as opposed to the current "expedition report", which is simply a report of what happened).
								This system could also have been coupled with the diplomacy system to improve relations with other empires.

							<header id="newgamepersonalization" class="style1">
								<h2>New Game Personalization</h2>
							</header>

							<p>We plan to provide players with a number of new options so that they can create the course that suits them best.
								These additional options included: the choice of species, the aggressiveness of the enemy empire, the gradual decline of relations with the AI empire, the basic income of resources on the players' worlds (or just the home world)...

								<h2>Evolving Bots</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
								In version 1.0 of From 1 AU, bots are fixed at the start of the game or when the next Kardachev scale is reached.
								A good improvement would have been, while keeping a few predefined empires, to generate evolving empires that develop their worlds and expand through colonisation. 
								Even if programming these behaviours would have taken time, it would have added a great deal to the feeling of life in the universe.
