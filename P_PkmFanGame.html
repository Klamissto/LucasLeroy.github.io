								<p>
									Pokémon Hyokyo (temporary name) is a Pokémon Fan game based on the Pokémon games and animes. I started co-develop this project in February 2024.
									It is developed using RPG Maker XP and the Ruby language. The game is currently developed in English but is planned to be available in French as well in the v1.0.
								</p>
								<p>
									Us, the two developers, player all the main Pokémon games; from Pokémon Yelllow back when we were five years old to Pokémon Scarlet/Violet last DLC in late 2023.
									As we were playing the DLCs of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, we have been reflecting of the whole serie and how it evolved.
									As we started pointing out flaws of every games we started discussing what the perfect Pokemon game would look like? 
									What kind of game we would have killed to have as kids?
									Even though we had some amazing Pokémon games when we were young (Pokémon Gold/Silver and their remake Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are, to this day the best and most complete Pokémon games I played), we did not see their flaws at the time.
									Now that we are older this is something that we can actually act on.
									That is why we decided to start this project.
								</p>
								<p>
									So what do we mean by flaws? These are only our opinion on the matter and does not take anything away from the Pokémon games.
									However, here I will go through few of them to give you an idea of what we are tying to put together:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>One thousand and what Pokémons? Are you crazy? How many are forgetabble? Most of the time, more Pokémon does not bring anything to the game except shallow content.
										Let's just keep the best ones (in our opinion, sorry if your favorite did not make the cut).</li>
									<li>Remember this amazing feature that was in this one game just to dissapear in the following? Let's bring it back.</li>
									<li>Legendaries that are more commun that your starter. Nope, not gonna happend. You want it, go look for it.</li>
									<li>I can't start the game with my favorite Pokémon. Now you will.</li>
									<li>The game can be beaten by a 5 years old with one (non optimized) Pokémon without a single game over. Yep, it's about time to tackle this one as well.</li>
									<li>Linear story line or shallow and empty open world, your choice (sometime both unfortunatly). Let's give you a trully open world with actually stuff in it.</li>
									<li>Stupid features like: Do I need a buddy to complete my Pokédex? No, you won't.</li>
									<li>In this game, let's introduced a new forgettable gimmick combat featured that was, somehow, unkown before! Nope, nope, and let's keep these tricks to a minimum.</li>
									<li>So the story will be: I live at my mom's (dad is missing, obviously), and I go to school with my friends, everybody is nice, except the excentric budget Team Rocket doing some evil (not so evil) stuff for no reason. 
										I will roll on everybody to become league champion, which is, somehow, considered a hard feat in the Pokémon World.
										You are sick of it? Yep, let's have a more mature game, we are not eight anymore.
									</li>
									<li>Finaly, one of the major flaw of the latest Pokémon games was that the bond between the player and his Pokémons was absent. 
										I do not even remember a single Pokémon of my team in Pokémon Sword and Shield to be honest. 
										Why? Too many Pokémons, there is little to no quest that put Pokémon in the center of the story (except for legendary Pokemon), and most importantly, somehow your Pokémons did not matter. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									I will go more in detail in each flaw, and more, in the dedicated section in which we try to fix/alter them. 
									Overall, this project is about bringing the player into the world of Pokémon.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is about an adventure with YOUR Pokémons. Here we want to bring back the feeling that was most present in the earliest games and the anime.
									If you do not know what I mean, try to imagine what Ash would look like without his Pikachu. 
									Or if you ever ditched you starter in the first three generation of Pokémon games. 
									I mean you could have done it, but I know I never did. 
									Why? Because they mattered to me.
									First thing I did in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was to ditch my starter for a weaker Psyduck. 
									I was not proud about it, but I could not care less about him.
									Bringing back this feeling will be, without a doubt, the most challenging aspect of this project but we will give it our best try.
								</p>
								<p>
									In this game not everything will be legendary, or previously unknown, or uncharted. The main character, did not discovered Pokémons, sorry.
									If there is one sentence that could summarise this game it would be: The Pokémon World, lore and games already have everything they needs, you just need to put it together properly.
									The game will, hopefully, be closer to the anime kind a vibe story wise (minus constant Team Rocket gimmicks). 
									Most of it will be about exploring the region of Hyokyo; unveiling stories about Pokémons and people; training your Pokémons (or not).
								</p>
								<p>
									For this project we wishes to do every extra added features, arts and stories by ourself.
									However, I have learned in the past that this is not substainable as this is, still, a small team project.
									Therefore we decided to start the project from the Pokémon Esssential (v21), which is a preset for RPG Maker XP to do Pokémon fan games.
									Additionnallly, we will also use some of the plugins created by the amazing Pokémon fans community when relevant. 
									I will always mention in this article when a feature was added to the game and created, even partly, by someone else. 
									If there is no mention and this is not in the Pokémon serie, we did it ourself.
									In addition to that, most of the credit goes to the Pokémon Compagny for most of the artwork, musics, and lore surrounding this game, obviously. 
								</p>
								<p>Disclaimers: 
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Needless to say that, eventhough I will try to keep it to a minimum, this article contain massive spoilers of the game. 
										Including the region, Pokémons, stories, secret and more that are part of the game itself.</li>
									<li>
										This is an undergoing project so informations here are not final, and may evolve in the future as the development of the game and this article progress.
									</li>
									<li>
										This game project has never been commercialised or distributed; it is for the personal use of its developers.
									</li>
								</ul>
