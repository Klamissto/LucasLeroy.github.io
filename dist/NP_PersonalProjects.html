									<p>People who know me won't be surprised to learn that a lot of my projects are related to video games. 
										Whether it's beating a difficult game, grinding a competitive game to the highest rank, or just playing for fun with friends, video games take up a significant amount of my time.
										For over 15 years, I've been tempering games by trying to eliminate their flaws. 
										I won't go into too much detail about the years of modding Pokémon games to my liking, which are, in the end, small projects.
										I've had a few failed RPG and Rogue Lite projects on Unreal Engine 4 and 5, respectively.
										These were mainly due to the fact that they were conducted by only one person, and that motivation disappeared after a few months (although I'm not closing the door on the Rogue Lite project just yet).
										Nevertheless, my two biggest game development projects are also the two most ambitious and best managed. 
										One of them has been developed to completion (From 1 AU), and the second is a Pokémon Fan Game, which is still in development but well on its way.
										So I'll be talking mainly about these two projects on their respective pages.
									</p>
									<p>
										A surprising thing happens when you first learn to code: you get the impression that you can solve everything with an algorithm. 
										This is largely true: if I can simulate a black hole accretion disc, how could it be wrong?
										So, from time to time, I tend to have weird ideas like "Could I code this or that? Could I beat this game without playing? Neural Network sounds fun, right?". 
										Although most of my attempts were not as successful as I had hoped, I did have a few successes.
										Unfortunately, most of my codes are lost between dead computers and fried hard drives. However, I did find one code from 2020 that's worth mentioning. 
										This code beats (I would even say 'crushes' because it smashed my personal record in 6 attempts) a mobile game called '2048' and I will talk about it in a dedicated page.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, I'm always up for craft and design activities. I'm not very good at drawing, but I always have ideas.
										I could talk about many small and medium-sized projects, from refurbishing flats to small crafts around the house, to painting the family's windsurfing trailer with a unique design. 
										However, I'll mention here a couple of personal projects of which I'm particularly proud: the painting and assembly of a bass guitar, and the carving of a Rudius.
