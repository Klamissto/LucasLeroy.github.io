							<h2>Pre High School Graduation (1995-2012)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							At elementary school, I was an insatiable and curious child. 
							Thanks to my parents and a few teachers, I was able to pursue my own projects in my spare time from a very early age.
							Whether it's an intellectual or athletic project, I've always put all my energy into it, expecting nothing but the best. 
							The activities I remember today include painting the school walls, training endlessly for cross-country races, completing maths workbooks from cover to cover, and an over the top project on the Roman Empire.
							In sport, this kid will challenge you as many times as necessary until you lose or give in.
							During this period, I started playing football and tennis at the age of 5 and 6 respectively. 
							As far as football is concerned, I mainly played with my older brother's team until the end of middle school.
							Everything was crazy for this kid, but fortunately I was surrounded by great people who supported me and helped me to make my plans a reality. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Back in middle school, I matured and, above all, I learned that I didn't have to be the best at everything.
							At that time, I mainly took part in cross country running competitions. I was also lucky enough to play table tennis for two years.
						</p>
						<p>
							In highschool, although I had a passion for history and handicrafts (I would have made one hell of an archaeologist!), I opted for mathematics.
							There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the French education system works like this: if you are good at maths, it is pretty much a given that you will continue in that direction.
							Secondly, my passion for science came later and, at the time, mathematics was an easy and comfortable path for me. 
						</p>
						<ul class="actions">

							<h2>CPGE (2012-2015)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							So here I am at the end of highschool, going into a CPGE (Classe Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles) in mathematics. 
							I did strongly consider going into design, again because of my love of craftsmanship.
							So why maths? Maths was easy for me, my big brother took the same path and he seemed to be doing well. So mathematics it was. 
						</p>
						<p>	
							However, I had the best time in CPGE. I made friends who are still very much part of my life today. 
							Moreover, for the first time in my life, the pace of learning was good for me. I think I found a fairly healthy balance between social life, sport, leisure and work during those years.
							While many people who went to CPGE remember it as a stressful period that they would not go back for the world, I spent some of my best years studying there.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was actually around this time that I got into music and started learning the guitar. 
							At the time, I made a pact with my neighbour at the time, who is still one of my best friends to this day: he would teach me guitar, and I would help him with maths, physics and coding.
							During the three years of CPGE, I spent many nights working with him with the sole aim of getting him to pass a specific competitive exam to, ultimatly, become a maths teacher, which he did in our final year of CPGE.
							I think I felt even better hearing that he had achieved what he wanted when the results came in than when I reached my own goal. Today, he is a middle school maths teacher.
						</p>
						<p>
							My years in CPGE were also the ones when I first learned to code and when I started to develop a greater interest in theoretical physics, thanks to my physics teacher in my second and third years.
							I got through the first year without a hitch. 
							Over these years, I've been working on two projects. The first was an analogy between the cycles found in the Rubix' Cube and the cycles in planetary transits.
							To this day, I still love this project; it was the perfect balance of creativity and maths/physics (for a second year university project level), and we certainly had a lot of fun doing it with my friends as part of the group project.
							A professor of mathematics at the University of Nantes even asked me to present the project to him. Even though it may seem silly, I am very proud of it.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second project was an evolutionary path-finding algorithm capable of finding a path in a changing environment.
							Funnily enough, the people who interviewed me for this project at the national oral exam did not believe that I had done it myself. 
							Fortunately, I did not need their help to get the school I wanted.
							The second year, when I took my first competitive exam, I underestimated the work I would have had to put in because of a lack of references in the matter.
							Whan the competitive exams came on the second year of CPGE, I under achieved to my standards, and decided to try another year, even though I had the second best results in my class.
							On my second attempt, I got what I was aiming for at the time, which was the Supélec engineering school.
							Why Supélec? Why not Centrale Paris, Polytechnique, ENS? 
							There were several reasons for this, but the main one was that I wanted to study abroad and Supélec was the only one at the time that allowed me to do this in exactly the way I wanted.
							Moreover, Supélec had the most flexible courses and allowed students in their second year to take part in a special project instead of the main curriculum.
						</p>
						<p>
							So that is the end of the CPGE part of my life. 
						</p>

							<h2>Engineering School (2015-2017)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							During the summer, just before starting engineering school, I worked for a month at Société Générale as a summer holiday helper. 
							The work essentially consisted of drawing up invoices with customer information, printing them and sending them out.
							It was a fairly robotic job to help the department in charge of it, which was swamped. 
							However, there were around 5,000 invoices to send out. The people who were in charge in July (and who should have done half of them) sent around 400.
							Because they did it one by one.
							After a week of working in this way, I wrote 10 lines of code in bash to automate the longest step in the process. We finished the remaining 4,000 or so in a week.
							That is when I realised that large companies like this are so complex and organised that there's very little room for initiative and innovation.
						</p>
						<p>
							One thing is important in understanding my path when I joined Supélec in 2015: whatever the quality or subject matter of the courses, I need to do things, to take part in team/personal projects, I don't like listening for hours on end to what I could find out on my own in less time.
							Therefore, I took the opportunity to take part in as many projects as possible, as part of the Supélec curriculum. 
							For example, I was part of a rowing team training for the French University Championship. 
							I have been involved in a number of associations and groups at Supélec, such as the various event organisation teams and the association in charge of the sound system at school events.
						</p>
						<p>
							My plan for the first year was simple: take what I could in terms of projects while maintaining a good enough GPA to get the master's and University abroad that I had identified for my third year: an MSc in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.
							Why this master's? Because you can choose any eight courses you like, as long as they are related to Applied Mathematics, and it featured a six-month master's thesis. 
							What I've loved about mathematics all these years is theoretical physics and Astrophysics in particular, and this master's degree was perfect for me to study that.
							Supélec required students to have a GPA of 3.7 to be able to apply for this master's degree, so that was my goal and I achieved it.
						</p>
						<p>
							As an end-of-year project, I decided to make a guitar tuner. Why? Because, as a guitarist, I wanted to know how to make one. And the project was considered difficult enough to guarantee a good grade, but easy enough for me to complete.
						</p>
						<p>
							Between the first and second years, students are required to complete a one-month internship at the entry level of a company. 
							my case, it was a physical job of preparing orders in a warehouse during a hot summer with shifting hours.
							However, it was my favourite work experience to date. The people were nice, of course, but there was also real teamwork.
							The day ended when all the orders had been carried out, so everyone was eager to contribute to the team effort to leave early.
							The main drawback, however, was the lack of possible innovation, and while it may have been fun for a month, I am not sure it would have been for a lifetime.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second year of engineering school was a bit special because my main objective was to succeed in applying to Imperial College in London.
							I have decided to turn away from most of the associations and limited projects that marked my first year. 
							The reason for this was that I thought I had completed my objectives for the first year and wanted to take on new challenges.
							Therefore, I decided to apply for a special second-year course called "long project" to join a start-up hosted by Supélec that had been created the previous year.
							This has had the advantage of replacing some of the theoretical lessons with practical work in the field, and of creating and contributing to a larger-scale real-life project.
							The aim of the start-up, called iFollow, was to develop and market an autonomous supermarket trolley.
							Along with another student, I was responsible for developing the trolley's rolling base. 
							The main outcome was the development of a prototype and suggestions for the next stage of the project.
							During this experience, I also chose to help the two founders market their project.
							For example, we applied for and obtained the title of "entrepreneurial student" from the "Pépite France" label for the strenght of the project.
							Thanks to my efforts and involvement in the creation of the company, I was given the opportunity to continue working at iFollow at the end of my second year of engineering school. 
							Unfortunately, I had to abandon it to pursue my goal of studying theoretical physics at Imperial College London, for which I had been accepted at the time.
							iFollow was one of the best experiences of my life, because it was so unique and educational.
							The company, which is still going strong, is now based in the Paris region and specialises in autonomous warehouse equipments and solutions.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the end of my second year of engineering school, I had to do a two-month internship. 
							I decided to extend it to a three-month internship, which was the maximum I could afford before going to London. 
							I chose to try my luck again with large companies, but this time I wanted to be part of a bigger project than my first experience at Société Générale.
							The team I worked with at Société Générale had just taken on a new activity: Qualified Intermediaries (QI). 
							This mainly involved managing QI transaction procedures for the US market. 
							In short, if you own US shares or are a US person, you will have to pay US tax. And the IRS (the US tax authority) is not at all kind about it. 
							Any bank that wishes to do business with the US market (i.e. any bank that wishes to prosper) has a duty to ensure that it complies fully with US laws, regulations and taxes. 
							Therefore, I was asked to carry out a pre-audit of the entire business in preparation for the actual audit in 2018 by the IRS. 
							This audit will determine whether the bank retains its QI status.
							In addition, at the end of my placement, I was responsible for training the members of the new QI team on the correct procedure to adopt to ensure compliance with US rules and a successful audit in 2018.
							When we received the results of the actual audit, only one error was found, in an incredibly rare case where even the people in charge of the audit weren't sure how it should be classified. 
							Needless to say, the audit was a complete success and the quality improvement team saved the bank from financial penalties (Société Général paid like 200$ of financial pénalities), making headlines in the process.
							This project was a lot of fun, our group was great, it was a quite interesting project and I am very proud of the work we did. 
							However, I didn't think I had a future in projects of this type, because they were mainly lacking in creativity and innovation.

						<p>
							So I am finally in London after years of planning. 
							It was a big step in my life, especially because I have been working on it since 2015 in CPGE.
							Then, people who have known me for a long time will also know that my English was pretty poor in 2017. 
							Throughout my studies, I relied on my ability to understand maths and physics with ease, while neglecting English.
							Moreover, I spent a whole year studying and working in a multicultural environment.
							That is why the year I spend in London is so important for the person I am today. 
							I couldn't have got my PhD in Astrophysics without fluent English.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							During my time at Imperial College London, I took courses in special relativity, quantum mechanics, stochastic processes, computer science and modelling.
							For my master's thesis (a six-month project), I decided to work with the head of the mathematics department at the time, Ryan Barnett.
							He was the professor responsible for the two quantum mechanics courses I took during the year. This master's thesis is therefore about quantum mechanics.
							The project concerned the study of a quantum random walk and its topological phases. 
							In simple terms, a quantum random walk does not go left OR right, it goes in both directions at the same time.
							As a result, patterns appear in the solution, which are, broadly speaking, the topological phases.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							It was the year I most enjoyed studying, for many reasons.
							For the first time, I was happy to go to classes; maybe that's why I didn't do a personal project on the side during this year.
							I still had trouble paying attention in some classes, but at least I was present, which was a big improvement. 
							Great people, great projects, great teaching. I have finally improved my English. London remains my favourite city. What more can I say, a perfect year.

							<h2>Back to France (2018-2019)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							At the end of my MSc at Imperial College London, I still had to do a six-month end-of-studies internship to obtain my engineering school diploma. 
							It was an important decision to make because my path until London was leading me towards a career in consulting, and this internship was my last chance to try something out before choosing a career path.
							At the time, I was torn between what people expected of me and what interested me. 
							I had such a good time in London studying theoretical physics that I started to think there might be a career here.
						</p>
						<p>
							So I went back to my mum's for four months and simply settled down because I realised that I had not had a holiday (apart from one week for Christmas every year) since 2014. 
							At this point, I had been concentrating for over four years on my studies, projects, applications, internships and preparing the ground for studying abroad. 
							I felt I needed a break to make the right choice for my future.
							During this period, I mainly shared life with the family, doing small craft projects, training for basketball and playing video games. 
							I have always played video games for fun, of course. 
							But also because I like to understand a game, what strategy can beat it, how the game works and operates. 
							For example, I reached Master 2k level on Heroes of the Storm (Blizzard's competitive PvP MOBA) during this period.
							I also started developing an RPG video game on Unreal Engine 4 at the time. 
							I was mostly experimenting with the softwares, but it made me want to develop video games.
							At that time, my experience of video game development consisted mainly of rom hacks and mods.
						</p>
						<p>
							After two months, I decided to use my last internship to try my hand at Astrophysics research, motivated by the experience of my year in London. 
							I got an internship at the CEA in the DAp (Astrophysics Department).
							I spent six months working on galaxy clustering for the EUCLID mission, which was extraordinary. 
							For the first time, I was deeply engaged in what I was working on as part of an internship. 
							I thought it was useful in the sense that I was creating something that not everyone could do, and that I wasn't just making money.
						</p>

						<p>
							After 2 or 3 months on internship, I decided to continue my research and try to apply for a PhD in Astrophysics. 
							Unfortunately, the timetable for getting such position started in March, at the very beginning of my placement, and I was already late for the competitive exam to get funding.
							Nevertheless, I received an offer for a position which I turned down because it was mainly an instrumental related topic. 
							Although I like crafts, I wanted to study the universe, not build a little high-tech probe.
						</p>
						<p>
							At an interview for another position, the supervisor of the future thesis rejected me solely because I didn't have a degree in Astrophysics.
							At that time, I already had all the necessary theoretical knowledge of astrophysics and I was ready (and wanted) to work at PhD level.
							I was very disappointed to see that a piece of paper was worth more than what I know and what I am capable of doing. 
							However, this person advised me to enrol on the "Master Recheche Astronomie, Astrophysiques et Ingénérie Spatiale" at Observatoire de Paris, which will put me on the right track for next year's PhD application process.
							Therefore, I applied for the course at the last minute. The interviews were taking place that very week. 
							I was asked to come practically the day after I had sent a Resume and a few words of motivation to a person with some connection to the master, who was kind enough to forward it to the right person. 
							It was a close call, but thanks to the advice I got I still managed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Over this summer, I built my own <a href="P_BassGuitar.html">Bass Guitar</a>, I will direct you to the dedicated page if you would like to learn more about it.

							<h2>Master Recheche Astronomie, Astrophysiques et Ingénérie Spatiale (2019-2020)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							The aim wasn't to get yet another degree, but to set myself on the right path to give myself the best chance of getting the PhD position I wanted.
							If someone had told me when I was at highschool that I was going to take so many degrees, I would have trained straight away as a woodsmith.
							Even though I did not learn much regarding the material presented in this course, the greatest value was that it introduced me to the field of Astrophysics research.
							Nevertheless, it was a fantastic year, I met some wonderful people and did a bit of a tour of Europe. 
							I joined a music jam group and started playing the piano.
							I have been involved in some awesome projects: I modelled the accretion disc of a black hole! How cool is that? 
							I have used some of the largest ground-based telescopes in France at Observatoire de Paris, Observatoire de Nancay and Observatoire de Haute Provence.
							One might think that I could have followed this path 4 to 7 years earlier, and skipped the whole CPGE/engineering school, but that's not true. 
							In fact, it is the path I have followed for nearly a decade that has led me to this point. 
							And if I had not taken all these steps, I would not have been able to fully enjoy my time at Observatoire de Paris, and what would follow.
						</p>
						<p>
							I used the time available to me to find the ideal PhD position with the ideal supervisor. I met David Elbaz in October 2019 and knew straight away that I would be doing my PhD with him.
							Not because of the topic of the position, which was about the properties and evolution of galaxies with Herschel and ALMA (and JWST), which was a remarkable subject and opportunity in itself. 
							But rather because the interview was already a classic, relaxed work discussion about the project, and not about my skills. 
							There I was, in front of this great world researcher, head of department, about to become head of research at the DAp at the CEA, he had every right to doubt me but he never did and was the nicest guy during the whole interview. 
							And like me, he had 100 other personal projects on the side.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I was so convinced that there was no way I was not going to do my PhD with David that I did not get a back-up PhD position (which was mandatory) when I applied for funding. 
							So I had to find one two days before the deadline to comply with the application procedure.
							I banked everything on this PhD position, despite the fact that there were around 20 grants (for more than 120 candidates) for the entire field of Astrophysics in France awarded as part of this competition.
							At this stage, fortunately, I had a better Resume than the other applicants: I spoke good English, I had already lived abroad, I had more varied experience, I had better grades and, above all, I knew why I was here. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Here we are, I'm starting my internship at the beginning of March 2020. After a week in the lab, badaboom you guessed it, you were there, the covid and the first lockdown in France.
							That was unfortunate... I was finally working with the team I'd been looking for for about a year and nope denied.
							It was at this time that I was working on my personal project for the mobile game "<a href="P_2048.html">2048</a>". 
							In any case, I went through the internship, which was simply a preparation for the following PhD and the competitive exam. 
							In the end, I obtained the funding through the competitive exam and the PhD position I wanted.

							<h2>PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics (2020-2023)</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							The subject of the thesis was the studying of the evolution of galaxy properties over cosmic time up to a range of stellar masses and redshifts never before achieved. 
							I redirect you to the page dedicated to my <a href="P_Thesis.html">PhD Thesis</a> if you want more informations on the matter.
						</p>

						<p>
							The first year was a bit chaotic because of the covid situation. 
							However, I cannot complain, I have had it easy and the laboratory team have been great, making sure that PhD students were not left on their own.
							It was also around this time that, during one of the lockdowns, I started co-developing a gestion space, UI based, game <a href="P_From1AU.html">From 1 AU</a> as a personal project.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							During the first year of my PhD, I was also a mathematics examiner in CPGE at the Institut Sainte Marie in Antony (near Paris). 
							I really enjoyed the experience and helping students through this period of their lives.
							I really wanted to help these students to the best of my ability (as I did for my friends when I was at CPGE myself).
							As a result, I spent quite a lot of time each week preparing maths exercises, which were personalised for each student (once we had got past our first meeting).
							When I do extra work like this, I do not want it to get only half my attention.
							As a result, I decided not to renew it in the second year, as I wanted to concentrate more on my PhD.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second year was the best: you're finally beginning to understand your project as a whole and you still have time. 
							Moreover, we were able to resume in person conferences and, above all, a normal life after the Covid situation of the previous year.
						</p>
						<p>
							The third year of my PhD was different for me, mainly because I started to get bored of my subject (which is common for PhD students in their third year). 
							During this year, I presented some of my findings (<a href="images/Research/LeroySesto2023.pdf">see slides</a>, 15 min talk + 5 min Q&A) at an international conference (<a href="https://www.sexten-cfa.eu/event/growth_galaxies_viii/">Sexten Center for Astrophysics Winter  2023</a>)
							It was at this point that I began to doubt whether I could continue to work as a researcher. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Why doubts? 
							It is not the field I am still passionate about, nor the people I wouldd work for again in a heartbeat.
							It is more because of research in general and what it would demand of me. 
							This can be summed up in two main points.
							First of all, to get a permanent position as a researcher, you have to spend 3 to 10 years in post-doctoral positions around the world before you get a chance.
							And if I am honest with myself, I do not want to move around like that, with no stability and no guarantee of success. 
							I am fine with the instability of work, but my family, my friends (at least most of them) and my life are in France and I do not want to move around too much.
							Secondly, when I started my PhD, I was perhaps a little idealistic about what research would be like: a perfect world where everyone worked together, putting their egos and self-interests aside, to improve human knowledge.
							At the end of my doctorate, I had to take an oath on exactly these values. 
							It made me feel very uncomfortable, because I really believed in these values, and this oath is unbearable if I want to have any kind of career in research.
							I know I am stupid, but that is the way I see it and the way I tried to conduct reseach during my PhD. Unfortunately, that is not how it works. 
							I can choose to conduct research in this way, no one can stop me. 
							However, I would give myself an even harder time that it already is to get a permanent position.
							I could be a bit stubborn in my values at times. 
							You can see that if you put all these reasons together, it may not be wise to continue in research.

							<h2>What now? (2023-now)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I defended my doctorate on 23 October 2023 and obtained another degree whose value lies more, once again, in the experience that led to it.
							At that time, I still had to publish the article I had written during my PhD.
							Therefore, as when I came back to London, I decided to settle down for a while, to find out where I am and what I would like to do next.
						</p>
						<p>
							During this period, I concentrated on what I loved.
							I took the time to look at a few books that I had been meaning to read for a long time.
							I started developing a Rogue Like video game on Unreal Engine 5. 
							This one failed, I lost motivation after a few months, doing everything on my own is difficult to substain. I might come back to it later.
							I have also played a few video games, earning the title of Grand Master on Overwatch in November 2023.
							I continued to work on my basketball skills.
							I took the time to plan a personal trip and to travel.
							I spent three weeks in the United States, in California, an then visiting a good friend who is currently doing a post-doctorate at Cornell (Ithaca, New York).
							In February, I began co-developing a <a href="P_PkmFanGame.html">Pokemon Fan Game</a> which is in good shape and whose progress I will describe in its dedicated page.
						</p>
						<p>
							So there you have it. In 2024, I am at peace with the imperfect person I am.
							At this stage of my life, Iam just looking to get involved in creative team projects.
							I'm interested in any company that can combine excellence, innovation, creativity and altruism in one job.
							That is probably why I like small video game studios so much.
							It just feel like few people have come together to create a piece of culture that others can enjoy. 
							I could bring a lot to such company like this: my creativity, my ideas, my energy, my dedication, my computational skills, my social skills, my scientific skills, my adaptability, my versatility.
