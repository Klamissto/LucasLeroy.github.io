							In this section, I will try to give you a more complete picture of my personal journey by explaining the choices I made and what I am looking for. 
							Hopefully, this will help you a grapse on who I am.
						</p>
						<header class="style1">
							<h2>Pre High School Graduation (1995-2012)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Back in elementary school, I was an insatiable and curious kid. 
							Thanks to my parents and some teachers, I was able quite young to purse my own projects on my free time.
							Whether it was intellectual or atletic projects, I always put all my energy in it expecting nothing but the very best. 
							From the activities I remember today I can mention repainting school walls, never ending training for cross country races, finishing maths drills books cover to cover, and an over the top project on the Roman Empire.
							At sport, this kid would keep challenging you as many time needed until you lose or concede.
							During this time, I started playing football and Tennis at 5 and 6 years old, respectively. 
							When it comes to football, I mostly played in the upper division with my big borther's team until the end of middle school.
							Everything was crazy about this kid but luckily I was surounded by great people who supported and helped me concretized my projects. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Back in middle school, I mature and mainly learned that I do not have to be the best at everything.
							It was the time, I was mostly involved in competitive cross country running. I also had the chance to play Table Tennis for 2 years while in middle school.
						</p>
						<p>
							In high school, although I was quite into History and manual work (I would have done a damn good Archeologist!), I went toward mathematics.
							There is two reasons for that. First this was how the french educationnal system worked, if you are good at maths it is pretty much written down for you that you will go on with maths.
							Second, the passion for the science came later and at the time mathematics was an easy and confortable path for me. 
						</p>
						<header class="style1">
							<h2>CPGE (2012-2015)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							So here I am at the end of high school going for a CPGE (Classe Préparatoire au Grandes Ecole) in mathematics. 
							I did strongly consider going into Design though, again because of my taste for crafting.
							Why mathematics then? Maths were easy for me, my brother went there and he seemed fine. And mathematics it is. 
						</p>
						<p>	
							However, I did have the best time there in CPGE. I made friends that are still very much in my life today. 
							Moreover, for the first time in my life the pace of learning was actually good for me. I think, I had a pretty healthy balanced between social life, sports, hobbies and work during these years.
							While many people who went in CPGE remember it as a stressing time that they would not go back for the world, it was, to me, some of my best years studying.
						</p>
						<p>
							This was actually the time I picked up on music and start learning guitar. At the time I made I pact with one of my best friend still to this day and my neighboor at the time: he teach me guitar, I help him out with mathematics, physics an dcoding.
							Through 3 years of CPGE, I spend numerous nights working with him with the sole purpose of getting him to succed in a specific competitive exam to claim on the path of becoming a mathematics teacher, which he achieved in our last year in CPGE.
							I think, I felt even better to hear that he got what he wanted when the results droppped than when I got my own goal. Now, he is a mathematics teacher in middle school.
						</p>
						<p>
							Anyway, my CPGE years were also were I learned coding for the first time and where I started to develop a stronger taste for theoritical physics, thanks to my 2nd year physics professor.
							I went through the first year smoothly. 
							During these years, I conducted two projects. The first one was an analogy between the cycle you could find in the Rubix' Cube and the cycle in planetary transit.
							To this day, I still love this project; it was the perfect balance between creativity and mathematics/physics (for a 2nd year of University project), and we surely had a lot of fun doing it with my friends in the group project.
							A professor of Mathematics at the University of Nantes even asked me to present him the project. Even though if this sound silly, I am still very proud of it.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second project was an evolving pathfinding algorithm that could the a path in an evolving environment.
							Funny enough, the people that interview me for this project at the oral national exam did not beleived I did it myself. Luckely I did need any point from them to get the school I wanted.
							On the second year, the one where I passed my first competitive exam, I under estimate the work I should have put in due to a lack of reference in the matter.
							Once the competitive exam came on the second year of CPGE, I under achieve to my standard, and decided to try another year even though I had the second best results of my class.
							On the second attemp I got what was my goal at the time which was the Supélec Engineering School.
							Why Supélec? Why not Centrale Paris or Polytechnique? 
							There were multiple reasons to that but the main one was that I wanted to go study abroad and Supélec was the only one at the time that would allow me to do it exactly the way I wanted to.
							Moreover, Supélec had the most flexible courses and allow in second year to take part in special project instead of the main cursus.
						</p>
						<p>
							So this is the end of the whole CPGE part of my life. 
						</p>
						
						<header class="style1">
							<h2>Engineering School (2015-2017)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							During the summer right before starting engineering school, I worked for a month at Societé Général as a summer holiday helper. The job was basically to make up bills with costumer informations, print them and send them.
							It was a pretty robotic work to helpout the service in charge of it that was swamped. However, they was about 5000 bills to send. The people in charge of it in July (and who should have done half of it) did 400 or so.
							Why? Because there were doing it one by one.
							After a week of doing it this way, I just wrote 10 lines of code in bash to automatise the longest step of the process. We finished the remaining 4000 or so in a week.
							This is where I understood that big compagny like this are on a level of complexity and organisation so high that there is very little room for initiative and innovation.
						</p>
						<p>
							To understand my journey when I integrated Supélec back in 2015: whatever the quality or material of classes, I need to do stuff, take part into team/personnal projects, I do not enjoy only listening for hours what I could figure out on my own in lesser time.
							Therefore, I took this as a chance to take part at as many project as possible as it was offered in Supélec cursus. 
							I was part of a rowing team training for the French University Championship. 
							I took part in multiple associations and groups within the Supélec school such as different event planning teams and the association in charge of the sound system at the school's events.
						</p>
						<p>
							My plan for the first year was simple: taking what I could projects wise while maintaining a GPA good enough to get the master and University abroad I spotted for my third year: an MSc in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.
							Why this master? Because you could picked whatever 8 classes you whises as long it is related to applied mathematics. What I liked in mathematics all these years was theoritical physics and in particular Astrophysics, and that master was perfect to let me study that.
							Supélec required the student to have a 3.7 GPA to be allowed to applied to this master, this was my objectif and I achieved it.
						</p>
						<p>
							As end of the year project, I decided to do a guitar tuner. Why? Because, as a guitar player, I wanted to know how to make one, and it was percieved to be hard enough to guaranty a good grade, but easy enough for me to complete the project.
						</p>
						<p>
							Between the first and second year, students need to complete a one month internship at entry level of a compagnie. 
							This was a physical work of order picking in warehouse during a hot summer and shifted hours.
							However, this was, to this day, my favorite working experience. People were nice of course, but there also was real team work.
							The day ended when all the order were done, so everybody was eager contribute to the team effort to get off early.
							The main drawback however was the lack of possible innovation, and while this was fun for a month I am not sure it would have been over a lifetime.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second year of the engineering school was a bit special because my main objective of the year was to successfully apply at the Imeprial College London.
							I decided to turn away from most of associations and limited projects that made my first year. 
							The reason was that I though I had completed my objectves of the first year and I wanted to go toward new challenges.
							Therefore, I decided to apply for a special second year path called "long project" to join a start up hosted y Supélec that was created the year before.
							This had the advantage to replace part of theoritical courses by some practical work on the field and to actually create and contribute to a larger real project.
							The purpose of the start up, name iFollow, was to develop, at the time, an autonomous supermarket trolley.
							I was in charge with another student of developping the rolling base of the trolley. 
							It mostly translated into developping a prototype and giving suggestion for the next stage of the project.
							During this experience, I also chose to help the two founders to market their project.
							For example, we applied and earn the title of "Entrepreneuship Student" at the label "Pépite France" for the strengh of the project.
							Due to my efforts and involvment in the start up, I was offer the opportunity to keep working at iFollow by the end of the second year of engineering school. 
							Unfortunatly, I had to leave it to pursue my goal of going study theoritical physics abroad at Imperial College London for which I was accepted by this time.
							iFollow was on of the greatest experience of my life as it was a quite unique and educationnal one.
							The compagny is still in very good shape to this day but is now located near Paris and specialized into autonomous warehouse equipements and solutions.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the the end of the second year of engineering school, I was required to complete 2 months internship. 
							I decided to extend it to a 3 months internship, which was the maximum I could afford before going to London. 
							I chose to give another shot at big compagnies but this time I wanted to be part of a greater project compared to my first experience at Société Général.
							The team I worked with in Societé Général was just getting the charge of a new activity: Qualified Intermediaries (QI). This basically was the gestion of the QI transaction procedures for the US market. 
							In short, if you own US stocks or you are US person you will need to pay US taxes. And the IRS (US tax department) is not chill about it at all. 
							It is a duty of any bank that wishs to trade with the US market (meaning any bank that wishs to prosper) to make sure they are in full compliance with US laws, regulations and taxes. 
							Therefore, I was in charge of making a pre-audit of all the activity in preparation for the real audit of 2018 performed by the IRS. 
							This audit will determined if the bank keeps its QI status.
							Moreover, by the end of my internship, I was in carge of forming members of the new QI team on the right procedure to adopt to ensure US rules are followed and that the audit of 2018 will be successful.
							When we got the results of the real audit, only one error was found on some incredebly rare case that even people from the audit were not sure how to classify. 
							Needless to say that the audit was a perfect sucess and that the QI team save the bank from financial penalities and so making headlines.
							This project was a ton of fun, our group was amazing, it was quite interresting project and I am very proud of the work achieved. 
							However, I did not felt like I had a future in projects of this kind, because it mainly lacked creativity and inovation.
						</p>
						
						<header class="style1">
							<h2>Imperial College London (2017-2018)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							So I am finally in London after years planning on it. 
							This was a huge step in my life, mostly because I have been working torward this since 2015 back in CPGE.
							Also people who know me from a long time, know that I was speaking quite a poor English back in 2017. 
							During all my studies I surfed on my habilities to comprehend maths and physics with ease, neglecting english.
							Moreover, I spend a full year studying and working in a multicultural environment.
							This is why this year I spend in London is so important to the person I am today. 
							I could not have gotten my PhD in Astrophysics without a fluent English.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							During my time at Imperial College London I picked classes on special relativity, quantum mechanics, stochastic processes, compuattion and modelisation.
							For my master thesis (6 months project), I decided to do it with the head of the Mathematics department at the time Ryan Barnett.
							He was the professor in charge of the two classes on Quantum Mechanics I followed during the year. Therefore, this master thesis was on a Quantum Mechanics project.
							The project was on the studying of a quantum random walk and its topological phases. 
							Simply put, a quantum random walk just don't go left OR right, it goes in both direction at the same time.
							As a consequence, patterns in solution arise which is what topological phases are (roughly).
						</p>
						
						<p>
							This was my favorite year studying for so many reasons.
							For the first time, I was happy to go to classes; which is maybe why I did not do any personnal project on the side.
							I was still having troubles listening in some of the classes, but at least I was there which was already a major improvment. 
							Great people, great projects, great teaching. I finally improved my english. London is my favorite city to live in to this day. What can I say, a perfect year.
						</p>

						<header class="style1">
							<h2>Back to France (2018-2019)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							By the end of my MSc at Imperial College London, I still needed to fufill a 6 months end of study internship to graduate from my Engineering School. 
							This was a big decision to do because my path until going to London was leading me toward a consulting carrier, and this internship was my last shot to test something to then make a carrier choice.
							And at the time, I was torn between what people expected me to do and what I was interrested in. 
							I had such a great time in London studying theoritical physics, I started to think there might be a carrier here.
						</p>
						<p>
							Therefore, I went back at my mom's for 4 months and simply cut off everything because I realised I did not had holidays (except 1 week for chrismas each year) since 2014. 
							It was, at this point, more than 4 years thats I was fully focus, on studying, projects, applications, internships and paving my way to go study abroad. 
							I just felt I needed a break to make the right choice for my future.
							During this time, I was mainly sharing the family life, doing small crafting projects, training for basketball and playing video games. 
							I always played video games for fun obviously. 
							But also because I like to understand a game, what strategy can beat it, how the game works and operates. 
							For example, doing so, reached a Master 2k level on Heroes of the Storm (the competitive PvP MOBA from Blizzard) during this time.
							I also started developping a RPG video game on Unreal Engine 4 at the time. I was mostly experimenting with the softwares but it did tickle my taste for developing video game.
						</p>
						<p>
							After, two months I took the decision to use my last internship to test research in Astrophysics motivated by the experience of my year in London. 
							I got an internship at CEA in the DAp (Departement d'Astrophysique).
							I work for 6 months on the clustering of galaxies which was amazing. 
							For the first time, what I was working on in an internship engaged me deeply. 
							I though that it was usefull in the sense that I was creating something, not everybody could do it, and I was not just making buisness of money.
						</p>

						<p>
							After 2-3 months of the start of the internship, I decided to pursue in research, and to try to apply for PhD position in the Astrophysics field. 
							Unfortunatly, the schedule to get such position started in march, at the very beginning of my internship, and I was already late to enter competitive exam for founding.
							Nevertheless, I did got an offer for a position that I turned down because this was mostly and an instrumental topic. 
							While I do like crafting, I wanted to study the universe, not craft a high tech small probe.
						</p>
						<p>
							While interviewing for another position, the supervisor of the future these rejected me solely base on the fact that I did not had any degree in Astrophysics specificaly.
							At this time, I already had all necessary theoritical knowledge about Astrophysics and was ready (and wanted) to work at a PhD level.
							I was a lot disapointed on the fact that somehow a piece of paper was worth more than what I actually know and able to do. 
							However, this person did advised me to apply and go in the "Master Recheche Astronomie, Astrophysique et Ingénérie Spatial" at Observatoire de Paris which will at least put me on track for next year PhD application process.
							Therefore, I applied last minute to this course. They were doing interviews this very week. 
							I was asked to come pretty much the day after I sended a Resume and few motivation words to a person a bit related to the master who was kind enough to follow it to the right person. 
							This was close, but thanks to the advising I still managed.
						</p>
						<p>
							During this very summer, I crafted my own <a href="P_BassGuitar.html">Bass Guitar</a>, I redirect you to the dedicated page if you would like to learn more about it.
						</p>

						<header class="style1">
							<h2>Master Recheche Astronomie, Astrophysique et Ingénérie Spatiale (2019-2020)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							The goal was not to get yet another diploma, but really to get into the right path to give me the best chance of getting the PhD position I wanted.
							One would have told me back in highschool that I was getting into this many diplomas journey I would have strait up go to a woodsmith formation.
							Even though I did not learn much regarding the material presented in this cursus, the greater value was to introduce me to the field of research in Astrophysics.
							This was, nonetheless, a great year, I met great people, went around Europe a bit. 
							I got involved in some music jam group and started to play piano.
							I took part in some awsome projects: I modelized the accretion disk of a black hole! How cool is that? I use some of the largest ground telecope in France in Observatoire de Paris, Observatoire de Nancay and Observatoire de Haute Provence.
							One could think I could I have gone to this cursus 4-7 years before, and skip the whole CPGE/Engineering School, but that is just not true. 
							In fact, this is the journey I have been through for almost a decade that led me to that point. 
							And if I were not gone through all these steps, I would not have been able to fully apreciate my time at Observatoire de Paris.
						</p>
						<p>
							I did took advantage of the time given to find the perfect PhD position with the perfect supervisor. I met David Elbaz back in october 2019, and I knew right away I would do my PhD with him.
							Not because of the topic of the position which was on galaxy properties and evolution with Herschel and ALMA (and JWST), which was a great topic and opportunity on its own. 
							But rather because the interview was already casual classic work discussion about the project, and not my abilities. 
							Here I was, in front of this top world researcher, head of department, on the verge of being the head of research at DAp at CEA, he would have had every right to doubt me but he never did and was been the nicest guy around for the whole interview. 
							And like me he had 100 extra projects on the side of his work.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I was so sure in my head there was no way I would not do my PhD with David that I did not had a back up PhD position while applying for a funding (which was mandatory). 
							So I had to find one 2 days before the deadline to complie application modalities.
							I bet everything on this PhD position depsite the fact that there is like 20 funding for the whole field of Astrophysics over France granted by this competitive exam.
							At this point, fortunatly, I did had a better resume compared to other applicants: I spoke good english, already lived abroad, had a more various set of experiences, better grades, and more importantly, I knew why I was here. 
						</p>

						<p>
							So here we are I am starting my internship early march 2020. After a week in the laboratory badaboom you guessed it, you were there, the covid and the first lockdown.
							That was unfortunate... I was finally working with the team I was looking for a year or so and nope denied.
							It was around that time that I did my personnal project on the "<a href="P_2048.html">2048</a>" mobile game. 
							Anyway, we went through the internship which was just a set up for the following PhD and the competitive exam. 
							Ultimatly, I got the funding through the competitive exam and the PhD position I wanted.
						</p>

						<header class="style1">
							<h2>PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics (2020-2023)</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							The topic of the Phd was about tracking the evolution of galaxy properties over the cosmic time to a range to stellar masses and redshift never achieved. 
							I redirect you to the page dedicate to my <a href="P_Thesis.html">PhD Thesis</a> if you want more informations on the matter.
						</p>

						<p>
							The first year was a bit chaotic due to the covid situation. 
							However, I cannot complain much I had it easy and the laboratory team was amazing making sure PhDs student were not left on their own.
							It was also the time during which I started developing, during one of the lockdown, a UI based gestion space game <a href="P_From1AU.html">From 1 AU</a> as a personal project.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							During this first year of my PhD, I also was a Mathematical Examinator in CPGE at Institut Saint Marie at Antony (near Paris). 
							I really enjoyed this experience and helping out student troughout this time of their life.
							I trully cared about helping these student to the best of my abilities (as I was for my friends back when I was myself in CPGE)
							As a result, it took me quite some time every weeks to prepare maths drills, that were personalized for each student (once past our first meeting).
							When I take part in extra-work like this, I do not want it to only get half my attention.
							As a consequence, I decided not to renew it in the second year as I wanted to focus more on my PhD.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second year was, the best part of it: you finally start to understand your project as a whole and you still have time. 
							Plus we could go back to conferences and more importantly to a normal life after the Covid situation of the previous year.
						</p>
						<p>
							The third year of the PhD was a bit harder, mainly because I started to be sick of my topic (which is common for PhD students in their thrid year). 
							During this year, I presented some of my results (<a href="images/Research/LeroySesto2023.pdf">see slides</a>) at an internationnal conference (<a href="https://www.sexten-cfa.eu/event/growth_galaxies_viii/">Sexten Center for Astrophysics Winter  2023</a>)
							I also started to have doubts on whether I would keep on as a researcher. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Why doubts? 
							It is not about the field which still possionnate me to this day, or the people for which I would work for/with again in an heartbeat.
							It is more because of the research in general and what it would require from me. 
							This can be summarized in two main points.
							First, in a way to get a permanent position as a researcher you need to complete 3 to 10 years of post doctoral positions all around the world before even getting a shot at it.
							And if I am been honnest with myself I do no want to move around like that, with no stability, and no guaranty of sucess. 
							I am fine with the instability of work, but my family, my friend (the majority at least) and my life is in France and I do not want to leave.
							Secondly, when I started my PhD I was maybe to idealist on what research would be: a perfect world where everybody work together, putting aside their ego and own interest, to improve human knowledge.
							I know I am stupid, but that is how I viewed it and how I tried to be during my PhD. It is, sadly, not how this is working. 
							I could chose to conduct research this way, nobody can stop me. However, I would give myself an even harder time that it already is to get a permanent position.
							I could be a bit stubborn in my values at times. You can see that putting these two reasons together it might not be the best decision to keep on research.
						</p>

						<header class="style1">
							<h2>What now? (2023-now)</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I defended my PhD on the 23th October 2023 and was granted yet another diploma that is worthless to me.
							By this time, I still needed to publish the paper I wrote during my PhD.
							Therefore, as when I cam back to London, I decided to settle for some times, to figure what I would like to do next.
						</p>
						<p>
							During this time, I focus doing what I liked.
							I took time to some books I meant to read for a long time now. I player some video game, I passed Grand Master on Overwatch in November 2023(yeah me).
							I also started developping a Rogue Like video game on Unreal Engine 5. This one blew, I lost motivation after few months, doing everything alone is hard. I might come back to it later though.
							I took some time to travel: I went 3 weeks in the United States, went around California and went visiting a good friend that is currently doing a post doct in Cornell (Ithaca, New York).
							In February, I started co-developing a <a href="P_PkmFanGame.html">Pokemon Fan Game</a> which is in good shape and that I will described the on going progess in a dedicated page.
						</p>
						<p>
							At this point of my life, I am simply looking for taking part of creative team project.
							I have little interrest in making money for myself or someone else. 
							My interrest goes to whatever compagny can bring together excellence, inovation, creation and altruisic in a job.
							That is probably why I like small video game studios so much.
							It just feel like few people coming together to create a part of culture for other people to enjoy. 
							I could bring a lot to such a compagny: my creativity, ideas, energy, dedication, computationnal skills, social skills, scientific skills, my adaptability, my versatility.
						</p>
						<p>
							So there it is. In 2024, I am finally at piece with the imperfect person that I am: honest, competitive, have excessively high standard from himself, and stubborn when it come to his values and the way he wants to live his life, and I do not care if it bothers you.
