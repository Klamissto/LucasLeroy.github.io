									<p>Back 2014 in Classe Pr√©paratoire I made a deal with my neighboor: he teach me guitar and I help him out with maths and physics. 
										And here I am in 2019 owing 3 Guitars and drums (the piano came later), talking with this same friends how neat it would be to build your own guitar.  
										So during this summer we both built a music instrument: him a Fender Strat, and me a Fender Jazz Bass guitar.
										This relation is probably the only reason why I still have pictures left of the craft and why I own that many music instruments. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I choose to go with a Bass guitar because I think I was already set my set of 3 guitars (an acoustic, an electric Yamaha Pacifica and a electric Gibson). 
										There is few advantages to assemble your guitar on your own: first its cheaper (almost half the price), you can make it look as you whish, and finally, let's face it this is fun.
										I viewed this as an opportunity to get a unique design so it took me a month and a half to chose the pieces and make the design. 
										Then a week of work was needed to paint and assemble the all instrument.

									<h2>The Pieces</h2>
								</header>
								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/BassGuitar/7.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The first of the project was deciding which piece I would use. 
										Even though you can build whatever kind of Bass guitar you wish there is still parts that do not fit each other.
										So if you do not want to have to recarve some pieces to make them fit you have to be carefull.
										Considering, I invested most of my saved money in this project I was not quite willing to test my woodsmith skills on this.
										Thus I went the safe way and picked a classic Fender Jazz Bass for the overall look of the body and the neck so that the join fit perfectly.
									</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<a  class="image left"><img src="images/BassGuitar/plaque.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> I will only talk about one other part of the set, because it is actully important to the whole design. 
										I wanted that the bass guitar feels like one articulated piece once painted. 
										I was not very found of having a pick gard because, I assumed I would play it with fingers and since I was painting the whole thing I might as well save the room.
										Thus I choose to go for a tone controls/output jack plaque in a shape of a rocket. This way this pieces is incorporated in the final design of the instrument and does not overlap or cut the rest of it. 
									</p>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<p> Finally, for the painting I went for a matt look that still let through some of the wood rings and marks.
										In addition, I also picked some matt vivid colour for the main drawings.
										One would also need some sand paper, undercoat paint, and narnish fi you would like a good lasting result.
									</p>
									<p>
										And here is it:

									<h2>The Design</h2>
								</header>
								<p>There is two designs for this bass guitar (front and back).
									For the front of the bass (left image), I tried to picture a calm mood with a Japanese cherry tree in flower under the moon light, smoothly windswept. 
									Meanwhile a rocket ship go through the sky leaving behind almost an almost cartoness trail.
									For the back design (right image), I wanted a more electric design and to feature my favourite bass player Micheal Peter Balzary "Flee" from the Red Hot Chili Paper.
									To this end, I took inspiration from a picture of the band taken for the "Stadium Arcadium" album (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jfeffects.com.br%2F2016%2F07%2Ffaixa-faixa-stadium-arcadium-red-hot.html&psig=AOvVaw0v28I_6HAyDpHR2D8ayyTU&ust=1714141027702000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCIiikovH3YUDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">"link here"</a>).
									In this peculiar photo, Flee is wearing an american football helmet with "HOT" printed on it.

									All these motifs were painted on the body of the guitar in successive layers using masking patterns.

									<h2>Putting All Together</h2>

								<a  class="image left"><img src="images/BassGuitar/23.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									The last part of the project was putting everything together. It was pretty strait forward at this point.
									For the most part it is pretty much like assembling a furniture, nothing special, except maybe that you do not have a plan so you better know where everything goes.
									Then there is the the soldering of the electric parts: the output jack, tone controles and pickups. Again pretty strait forward if you ever solder anything.

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
								Overall, this was a great project. If you are a musicien, there is nothing quite like having your own unique instrument espacially if it features your own design. 
								So if your are into it, I could not press you enough to try it yourseld. Ultimatly there is not much that could go wrong if you are carefull and plan the whole project. 
								In particular, if you are into electric guitar kind of instrument, you do not need a luthier to make sure it sounds good.
								Sure, when I look at it today, I see flaws in the design and I would do a better job if I were to do it again. 
								Nevertheless, the bottom line is that I have a Bass Guitar that I made mylsef, which is pretty unique and quite neat.
