								<p>
									Pokémon Hyokyo (temporary name) is a Pokémon Fan game based on the Pokémon games and animes. 
									I started co-developing this project in February 2024.
									It is developed using RPG Maker XP and the Ruby language. 
									The game is currently being developed in English, but it is planned that it will also be available in French in version 1.0.
								</p>
								<p>
									We, the two developers, have played all the major Pokémon games, from Pokémon Yelllow, when we were five, to the latest DLC of Pokémon Scarlet/Violet, at the end of 2023.
									When we played the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLCs, we reflected on the whole series and how it evolved.
									As we began to point out the shortcomings of each game, we started to discuss what the perfect Pokemon game would look like.
									What kind of game would we have killed to have when we were kids?
									Even though we had some amazing Pokémon games when we were young (Pokémon Gold/Silver and their remake Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are, to this day, the best and most complete Pokémon games I have ever played), we didn't see their flaws at the time.
									Now that we are older, it is something we can do something about.
									That is why we decided to launch this project.
								</p>
								<p>
									What do we mean by "flaws"? This is just our opinion on the matter, and it does not take anything away from the original Pokémon games which has produced great games for several decades.
									However, I am going to go through a few of them to give you an idea of what we are trying to put together in this project:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A thousand and some Pokémon? Are you crazy? How many are forgettable? Most of the time, more Pokémon adds nothing to the game other than superficial content.
										Let's just keep the best ones (in our opinion, sorry if your favourite did not make the cut).</li>
									<li>Remember that amazing feature that was present in one game and disappeared in the next? Let's bring it back.</li>
									<li>Legendaries who are more common than your starter. Nope, that is not going to happen. You want it, go and get it, we willmake it difficult for you.</li>
									<li>I cannot start the game with my favorite Pokémon. Now you, most likely, will.</li>
									<li>The game can be beaten by a five-year-old with a single (unoptimised) Pokémon without any game over. Yes, it is about time to tackle this one too.</li>
									<li>A linear story line or a shallow, empty open world, the choice is yours (sometimes both, unfortunately). Let's give you a real open world filled with things to do.</li>
									<li>Stupid features like: Do I need a friend to complete my Pokédex? No, you won't.</li>
									<li>In this game, let's introduce a forgettable new fighting gimmick that was, somehow, previously unknown! Nope, nope, and let's keep those gimmicks to a minimum.</li>
									<li>The story goes like this: I live with my mum (dad is missing, obviously), and I go on an adventure with my classmates. Everyone is nice to me, except for the eccentric budget Team Rocket, who does evil (not that evil) things for the sake of being evil. 
										Along the way, I will be the chosen one, because nobody is interested in you if you are not special.
										I will be catching Legendaries faster than I can eat oreos out of the packet, and discovering a whole shitload of previously unknown but obvious facts about the Pokémon world, which will make me wonder if other people have eyes.
										I will roll over everyone to become league champion, which is, somehow, considered an impressive achievement in the Pokémon world.
										Not interested? We agree, let's play a more mature game, we are not eight years old any more.
									</li>
									<li>Finally, one of the main shortcomings of the latest Pokémon games was the lack of connection between players and their Pokémons. 
										To be honest, I cannot even remember a single Pokémon from my team in Pokémon Sword and Shield. 
										Why is that? There are too many Pokémons, few if any quests that put Pokémon at the centre of the story (with the exception of legendary Pokémon), and above all, in a way, your Pokémons do not matter. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									I will go into more detail on each flaw, and more, in the dedicated section where we try to correct them. 
									Overall, this project aims to bring players into the world of Pokémon.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is an adventure with YOUR Pokémon. We want to bring back the feeling that was most present in the first games and in the anime.
									If you do not understand what I mean, try to imagine what Ash would look like without his Pikachu. 
									Or if you ditched your starter in the first three generations of Pokémon games. 
									You could have done it. I know I never did, and I have played them over and over again.
									Why? Because they mattered to me.
									The first thing I did in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was to ditch my starter for a weaker Psyduck. 
									I am not proud of it, but I could not care less about him.
									Bringing that feeling back will undoubtedly be the most challenging aspect of this project, but we will give it our best shot.
								</p>
								<p>
									Not everything in this game will be legendary, unknown or unseen. The main character is not that special, and, has not discovered any Pokémon, sorry.
									If there's one sentence that could sum up this game, it would be this: The Pokémon world, lore and games already have everything they need, they just need to be put together properly.
									The game will, hopefully, be closer to the anime story wise (minus the constant Team Rocket gimmicks). 
									The main focus will be on exploring the Hyokyo region, discovering stories about Pokémon and people, and training your Pokémons (or not).
								</p>
								<p>
									For this project, we wanted to create all the extra features, art and stories ourselves.
									However, I have learned in the past that this is not substainable as this is, still, a small team project.
									So we decided to start the project with Pokémon Essential (v21), which is a preset for RPG Maker XP that lets you create Pokémon fan games.
									In addition, we will also be using some of the plugins created by the incredible community of Pokémon fans where appropriate. 
									In this article, I will always mention cases where a feature, which has been added to the game, was created, even partially, by someone else. 
									If there is no mention of it and it is not in the Pokémon series, we have done it ourselves.
									In addition, the Pokémon Compagny deserves much of the credit for the game's artworks, musics and lore, obviously. 
								</p>
								<p>Disclaimers: 
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Needless to say, although I will try to keep it to a minimum, that this article contains huge spoilers about the game. 
										Including the region, Pokémons, stories, secrets, features and much more that are part of the game itself.</li>
									<li>
										This is an ongoing project, so informations listed here are not definitive and may change as the game and this article develop.
									</li>
									<li>
										This game project has never been commercialised or distributed; it is intended for the personal use of its developers only.
									</li>

							Before delving into the arts we have developed for this game, I need to talk about a few of the game's specifications: 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The resolution of the game is 512x384 pixels. </li>
							<li>The sprites and artworks have a 2-pixels unit, which means that what appears to be a pixel on the screen is in fact a 2x2 pixel square.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							It is this pixel unit that gives the  game its GameBoy Advance old-fashioned look. 
							Because we want to keep this look for the game, we have made sure that all the items and sprites in the game respect this 2-pixels unit.
							However, such a unit results in a rather crude and angular user interface (UI). 
							We therefore decided to use a 1-pixel unit for the UIs to modernise them somewhat.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
						<header id="therecipebookui" class="style1">
							<h2>The Recipe Book UI</h2>
						</header>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/recepibook_ui.gif" alt="" /></a>
						<p> 
							To achieve this, the UI wanted it to be a notebook in which players would write down the recipes they received.
							In this case, we have taken inspiration from the style of the Pokédex in Pokémon Legend Arceus.
							We thought this UI was quite effective and matched the style we were looking for.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have redesigned the UI (top left gif) to match the screen resolution and theme of the game.
							The UI has been coded and designed largely from scratch, but uses small pieces of code taken from the "Modular Pause Menu" plugin by Luka S.J. and A.I.R, mainly for reasons of consistency across the various UI codes.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							The aim of The Recipe Book interface is to provide quick access to the recipes that the player knows.
							To ensure that this interface is effective, we have taken care to provide access to a range of information so that players can gather ressources and craft items efficiently:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>All necessary ingredients.</li>
							<li>The number of each ingredient required.</li>
							<li>The number available in the player's bag.</li>
							<li>A description of the corresponding craftable item.</li>
						</ul>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/meal_ui-pic.png" alt="" /></a>

						<p>
							In the same style, we have created a UI for meal preparation (image bottom left), which mainly involves choosing the berries the player wants in their meal.
							I refer you to <a href="#thecraftingandrecipesystem" class="nobr">The Crafting and Recipe System</a> feature if you are interested in the mechanics behind meals.
						</p>
						<p>
							This UI feels a bit to much packed to my taste. 
							However, there is a lot of information that the player needs to easily prepare a meal.
							We wanted this feature to enhance the gaming experience and be as intuitive to use as possible.
							All in all, we are fairly satisfied with the result.
						</p>
						<p>
							We decided to have just 5 (by adding 1 to 5 berries to the pot) so that players can instinctively cook the meal they need, rather than spending several minutes looking for the right recipe from over 100 (as in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if the player needs to recover some HP and revive one Pokémon, all they have to do is browse through the available berries and choose the ones that will enable them to achieve just that.
							This way, the player only has to do a minimum of thinking, just knowing what they need out of the meal is already enough.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this user interface, we have taken care to include all the information the player needs to prepare the meal they require (from top to bottom):
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The number of berries needed for this meal.</li>
							<li>Berries already selected.</li>
							<li>For each meal statistic (HP recovered, PP recovered, status effects healed, and Pokémon resurrected):</li>
							<ul>
								<li>The current statistic, in dark blue for the progress bar and side text.</li>
								<li>The expected stastatistictus if you choose the berry currently highlighted, in light blue for the progress bar and side text.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>For the current highlighted berry:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>The number of berries of this type in the player's bag.</li>
								<li>Statistical values for the berry in each category.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<ul class="actions">
							<li><a href="#summary" class="button style1">Back to summary</a></li>
