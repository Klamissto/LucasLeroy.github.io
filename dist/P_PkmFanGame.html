								<p>
									Pokémon Hyokyo (temporary name) is a Pokémon Fan game based on the Pokémon games and animes. 
									I started co-developing this project in February 2024.
									It is developed using RPG Maker XP and the Ruby language. 
									The game is currently being developed in English, but it is planned that it will also be available in French in version 1.0.
								</p>
								<p>
									We, the two developers, have played all the major Pokémon games, from Pokémon Yelllow, when we were five, to the latest DLC of Pokémon Scarlet/Violet, at the end of 2023.
									When we played the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLCs, we reflected on the whole series and how it evolved.
									As we began to point out the shortcomings of each game, we started to discuss what the perfect Pokemon game would look like.
									What kind of game would we have killed to have when we were kids?
									Even though we had some amazing Pokémon games when we were young (Pokémon Gold/Silver and their remake Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are, to this day, the best and most complete Pokémon games I have ever played), we didn't see their flaws at the time.
									Now that we are older, it is something we can do something about.
									That is why we decided to launch this project.
								</p>
								<p>
									What do we mean by "flaws"? This is just our opinion on the matter, and it does not take anything away from the original Pokémon games which has produced great games for several decades.
									However, I am going to go through a few of them to give you an idea of what we are trying to put together in this project:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A thousand and some Pokémon? Are you crazy? How many are forgettable? Most of the time, more Pokémon adds nothing to the game other than superficial content.
										Let's just keep the best ones (in our opinion, sorry if your favourite did not make the cut).</li>
									<li>Remember that amazing feature that was present in one game and disappeared in the next? Let's bring it back.</li>
									<li>Legendaries who are more common than your starter. Nope, that is not going to happen. You want it, go and get it, we willmake it difficult for you.</li>
									<li>I cannot start the game with my favorite Pokémon. Now you, most likely, will.</li>
									<li>The game can be beaten by a five-year-old with a single (unoptimised) Pokémon without any game over. Yes, it is about time to tackle this one too.</li>
									<li>A linear story line or a shallow, empty open world, the choice is yours (sometimes both, unfortunately). Let's give you a real open world filled with things to do.</li>
									<li>Stupid features like: Do I need a friend to complete my Pokédex? No, you won't.</li>
									<li>In this game, let's introduce a forgettable new fighting gimmick that was, somehow, previously unknown! Nope, nope, and let's keep those gimmicks to a minimum.</li>
									<li>The story goes like this: I live with my mum (dad is missing, obviously), and I go on an adventure with my classmates. Everyone is nice to me, except for the eccentric budget Team Rocket, who does evil (not that evil) things for the sake of being evil. 
										Along the way, I will be the chosen one, because nobody is interested in you if you are not special.
										I will be catching Legendaries faster than I can eat oreos out of the packet, and discovering a whole shitload of previously unknown but obvious facts about the Pokémon world, which will make me wonder if other people have eyes.
										I will roll over everyone to become league champion, which is, somehow, considered an impressive achievement in the Pokémon world.
										Not interested? We agree, let's play a more mature game, we are not eight years old any more.
									</li>
									<li>Finally, one of the main shortcomings of the latest Pokémon games was the lack of connection between players and their Pokémons. 
										To be honest, I cannot even remember a single Pokémon from my team in Pokémon Sword and Shield. 
										Why is that? There are too many Pokémons, few if any quests that put Pokémon at the centre of the story (with the exception of legendary Pokémon), and above all, in a way, your Pokémons do not matter. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									I will go into more detail on each flaw, and more, in the dedicated section where we try to correct them. 
									Overall, this project aims to bring players into the world of Pokémon.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is an adventure with YOUR Pokémon. We want to bring back the feeling that was most present in the first games and in the anime.
									If you do not understand what I mean, try to imagine what Ash would look like without his Pikachu. 
									Or if you ditched your starter in the first three generations of Pokémon games. 
									You could have done it. I know I never did, and I have played them over and over again.
									Why? Because they mattered to me.
									The first thing I did in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet was to ditch my starter for a weaker Psyduck. 
									I am not proud of it, but I could not care less about him.
									Bringing that feeling back will undoubtedly be the most challenging aspect of this project, but we will give it our best shot.
								</p>
								<p>
									Not everything in this game will be legendary, unknown or unseen. The main character is not that special, and, has not discovered any Pokémon, sorry.
									If there's one sentence that could sum up this game, it would be this: The Pokémon world, lore and games already have everything they need, they just need to be put together properly.
									The game will, hopefully, be closer to the anime story wise (minus the constant Team Rocket gimmicks). 
									The main focus will be on exploring the Hyokyo region, discovering stories about Pokémon and people, and training your Pokémons (or not).
								</p>
								<p>
									For this project, we wanted to create all the extra features, art and stories ourselves.
									However, I have learned in the past that this is not substainable as this is, still, a small team project.
									So we decided to start the project with Pokémon Essential (v21), which is a preset for RPG Maker XP that lets you create Pokémon fan games.
									In addition, we will also be using some of the plugins created by the incredible community of Pokémon fans where appropriate. 
									In this article, I will always mention cases where a feature, which has been added to the game, was created, even partially, by someone else. 
									If there is no mention of it and it is not in the Pokémon series, we have done it ourselves.
									In addition, the Pokémon Compagny deserves much of the credit for the game's artworks, musics and lore, obviously. 
								</p>
								<p>Disclaimers: 
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Needless to say, although I will try to keep it to a minimum, that this article contains huge spoilers about the game. 
										Including the region, Pokémons, stories, secrets, features and much more that are part of the game itself.</li>
									<li>
										This is an ongoing project, so informations listed here are not definitive and may change as the game and this article develop.
									</li>
									<li>
										This game project has never been commercialised or distributed; it is intended for the personal use of its developers only.

						<p>
							In this section, I will be presenting the Hyokyo region in which this Pokémon Fan Game takes place.
							I will be presenting the world map, the Pokédex (i.e. the Pokémon that can be found in Hyokyo) and the starters (i.e. the pool from which players can choose their first Pokémon).
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
						<header id="theworldmap" class="style1">
							<h2>The World Map</h2>
						</header>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/mapRegion2_NoUI.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p> 
							For the world map, we have tried to reach the level of the Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerauld map, which we think is almost perfect.
							Why almost perfect? It managed to include different biomes in a meaningful and fluid way. What's more, the developers at the time managed to make every road, cave and mountain unique.
							Only the water routes feel similar, but even here there are specific features that make them unique in the Hoenn region.
						</p>
						<p>
							In designing the map, we therefore decided to include a variety of biomes and try to link them together in a somewhat realistic way.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>In the centre of the map, you will find plains and forests.</li>
							<li>In the centre-west lies the Al-Kahla desert.</li>
							<li>To the north-west are mountains, caves and the Mount Igneous volcano.</li>
							<li>To the south-west lies a dense jungle.</li>
							<li>To the south-west, on the water, is a group of atolls.</li>
							<li>To the south, an island formed by a meteorite impact and the deep water zone.</li>
							<li>To the south-east, is an archipelago of ancient volcanic islands.</li>
							<li>In the ceentre-east, is a swampy area.</li>
							<li>To the east is an area of dense forest.</li>
							<li>To the north-east, there are caves and high snow-capped mountains.</li>
							<li>To the north, there are low-lying mountains, caves and a mountain lake.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							However, compared to the Hoenn region, we have decided to draw a land region, instead of a sort of island.
							We felt that such a diversity of biomes would be difficult to find realistically on an island.
							In addition, a number of islands are already part of the region itself. 
						</p>
						<p>
							When we placed all the Pokémon in the region, we took care to place them in the ecosystem to which they belong.
							We wanted the world to feel alive and waiting for the player to discover it.
							As a result, you may have trouble finding Fire Pokémon in forests or near grass.
							In the Pokémon game, only one or two types of Pokémon of a specific lineage are usually found in the wild on a given route.
							The reason for this is that the game has been designed in a linear fashion, and it would not make much sense to have the player face a random level 45 Raticac right after the first town.
							To deal with this problem, the routes in the Pokémon games franchise are mainly level areas.
							Compared to the Pokémon franchise, in the Hyokyo region you can find all the Pokémon in their respective biomes, with the exception of non-roaming legendaries.
							This way, one really gets the impression that the Pokémon live and evolve there. 
							I refer you to the <a href="#overworldpokemons" class="nobr">Overworld Pokémons</a> section if you are interested in how we can make this work in terms of game functionality.
						</p>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/mapRegion2.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							As the game is supposed to be an open world, we have designed the paths to allow the player to go pretty much anywhere in any order they want.
							The player starts the game in Nishitsu, in the centre of the map, at the eastern end of the Al-Kahla desert.
							From there, and after the introduction, they can go wherever they want, no path is blocked.
							The underlying idea was that we did not want the player to feel entitled to follow a predetermined path.
							This may be more difficult to put in place, but it has a few of advantages:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>It enhances the player's immersion and sense of belonging to a connected and living world.</li>
							<li>This increases replayability and the feeling of discovering the region in your own way.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							It comes with a number of challenges to balance the difficulty of wild Pokémon and trainers. 
							I refer you to the <a href="#levelscaling" class="nobr">Level Scaling</a> section if you are interested in how we tackle this problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							As in the Hoenn region, each road, cave and mountain is designed to be unique. 
							Each has its own unique design, atmosphere, climate, quests, secrets and Pokémon.
							This is a very important point for us, because we want every route to be worth visiting and exploring. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Unlike most Pokémon games, which guide the player through the region, unlocking new paths as the story unfolds, here we aim to give the player more freedom.
							Of course, some quests will require you to go to a specific location. 
							But players will not have to wait for the story to progress before getting there.
							Some secondary paths may still be blocked by a specific ability or story, but no town will be out of reach because of the main quests.
							The idea behind it is simple: if so many other people have managed to reach such a place in a fairly well-mapped region, why should not you?
							Hopefully, this will result in a more credible and organic world, while giving the player real freedom.

							<h2>The Pokédex</h2>
						</header>
						<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/Pokemon/Pokemon-pokedex.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							The Hyokyo region has 617 Pokémons. It includes 45 Pokémon forms (Galar, Alolan, Paldean and Hisuian) and 30 Legendary Pokémons.
						</p>
						<p>
							The way we chose the Pokémons was simple: we chose the ones we liked, and discarded the ones we did not like. 
							We did this bearing in mind that we had to fill an entire region with various biomes with Pokémons, obviously.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Pokédex therefore contains most of the first three generations of Pokémon (Kanto, Johto and Hoenn), as well as their forms. 
							We have added all the good ones, in our opinion, in subsequent generations.
							This leaves us with almost 50% of the grand total of around 1,300 Pokémons available.
							To be honest, it is more than I expected, and it is a credit to the artists and designers of the Pokémon games that they have managed to get such a variety of good and great Pokémons.
						</p>
						<p>
							We thought that players should be able to fill their Pokédex and obtain all the Pokémon on their own.
							We understood the commercial value of hiding a few Pokémons behind a trading mechanism.
							However, we are not going to make any money out of it, and we do not think a forced trading feature is the best kind of multiplayer feature this franchise has to offer.
							We have therefore decided to remove this obstacle.
							All Pokémon that evolve through trade have been reworked to evolve through leveling up or a stone mechanism.
						</p>
						<p>
							While it was creatively tempting to create and add our own Pokémons to this Pokédex, we really felt that Pokémon games do not need Pokémon additions to be great games.
							This game is in fact a proof of concept of this idea.
							Already with "From 1 AU", which we developed, we had no intention of adding new features just for the sake of adding new things. 
							We do not believe that new means better, and that is simply not the way we create and design games. 
							So we have decided to limit ourselves to Pokémons that already exist.
						</p>
						<p>
							In case you are interested in a precise list of all the Pokémons available, here is a link:

							<h2>The Starters</h2>
						</header>
						<a  class="image centered"><img src="images/Pokemon/Pokemon-starters.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							We always thought it was a shame not to let the player choose which pokémon to start their journey with.
							It's true that classic starter Pokémons are generally more charismatic and better than others. 
							However, in my case, there is no way I am doing a playthrough without my Gengar.
							I might as well get a Gastly as a starter, if I wanted to. 
							Of course, I would likely have a hard time at the start of the game against just about anyone, because Gastly is pretty weak and only knows Lick for a good part of the early game.
							But that is precisely why it would never occur to me to ditche such a starter: we have been through this together.
						</p>
						<p>
							This also touches on a point I made earlier: not everything has to be legendary or unknown.
							Your favourite Pokémon is a Cartepie, and you want to start the game with it, so you should be able to.
							Why, in every Pokémon game, do you have to be the chosen one, constantly hit by insulting luck?
							In most Pokémon games you are usually the best throughout the whole run, which is not very challenging.
							I prefer to immerse myself in a story where you're nothing special and have humble beginnings, but work your way to the top, IF you want to: that's what life is like for most of us.
						</p>
						<p>
							In our opinion, this freedom in the choice of starter not only strengthens the bond between the player and their first Pokémon, but also offers a wide variety of playthroughs and play styles.
							For example, if I start with a Gastly, it is very unlikely, or at least quite a challenge, to take care of the normal gym first (the one in the starting town).
						</p>
						<p>
							In total, there are 208 possible starters in this game. 
							The only requirements for a Pokémon to be a starter were that not to be a Legendary and to be the first Pokémon in a Pokémon line (i.e. have at least one evolution).
							We hve decided to reserve starter status for those who have at least one evolution, as this is your first Pokémon and you will most likely have it for the whole game.
							It could therefore be important for players to feel some form of evolution in their Pokémon, and this could be achieved through the evolution of the starter into another form.
							It is debatable whether we should have included other Pokémon in the the starter pool, but that is what we chose to do.

							In this section, I am going to try and give an overview, without going into too much detail, of the direction and type of stories you can expect in this game.
							Needless to say, this section is particularly prone to spoilers relating to the game's various storylines.
						</p>
						<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
						<header id="themainquests" class="style1">
							<h2>The Main Quests</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							As for the main quest, we wanted it to meet a few criteria:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To be open world frendly, i.e., not to block the player's exploration of the region.</li>
							<li>No main quest leading to a legendary Pokémon.</li>
							<li>The player is not the chosen one from the start of the main quest.</li>
							<li>To have realistic characters rather than predictable clichés and overly charismatic characters. 
								That is easier said than done, but we will do our best.</li>
							<li>The player isn't going to save the world from a global cataclysm.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							As I have already said, this game is more about bringing the player into the world of Pokémon than giving them the thrill of an overly improbable and pyrotechnic story.
							We want the quests to give players the illusion that they are as much a part of the Pokémon world as the next bugcatcher trainer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now let's talk about the main quests.
							Although the main quests themselves were not very interesting, we really enjoyed the three directions (gym battle, "team rocket" and exploration quests) of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's main story line.
							We thought it was a clever way of letting the player choose their path and the type of quests they wanted to pursue first, and particularly suited to an open world.
							Therefore, we have decided to divide our main quests into three lines:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/Quest_UI_Main_Gym.png" alt="" /></a>
							<br>
							<li>A quest line on gyms.</li>
							<br>
							<br>
							<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/Quest_UI_Main_Rocket.png" alt="" /></a>
							<br>
							<li>A quest line about the Team Rocket.</li>
							<br>
							<br>
							<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/Quest_UI_Main_Research.png" alt="" /></a>
							<br>
							<li>A quest line based on exploration and research.</li>
							<br>
							<br>
						</ul>
						<p>
							At the start of the game, the player takes on the role of a young researcher at Nishitsu University. 
							They will work in the team of Professor Tamboti and other researchers at Nishitsu University.
							During the introduction, players will receive their first Pokémon, all the information they need to start their journey, and meet some of the main characters from the different story lines.
							After the introduction, which lasts around 15 to 30 minutes, players are free to roam the region and undertake any quest line they wish. 
						</p>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/img_mainQ_gym.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							The quest line to take on the gyms is a classic of Pokémon games. 
							In our game, players will experience it alongside Clariss, a competitive trainer who is also trying to reach the top.
							Along the way, players will learn more about the history of Clariss.
							The player must be careful what he says to her, as she can become a great friend or a salty nemesis depending on how the player behaves towards her.
							Clariss will always have an advantage over the player, exploiting their own weaknesses, as she has carefully built and trained her team.
							For example, her first Pokémon is the worst possible opponent for the player's starter, out of her final team.
						</p>
						<p>
							The history of the gym will consist mainly of beating gyms.
							There are 18 conventional gyms in the Hyokyo region, one for each type.
							Before each gym, the player will always have to complete a unique puzzle, riddle or mini-quest alongside the gym leader.
							Each gym is unique in its design and atmosphere.
							If you would like to know how we manage the levels of the gym leaders (and the trainers in general) in an open world, I refer you to the <a href="#levelscaling" class="nobr">Level Scaling</a> section.
						</p>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/img_mainQ_rocket.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							In this Team Rocket quest line, you will set off on an adventure in the footsteps of Team Rocket in the Hyokyo region.
							The player and Patrick, a Team Rocket nerd who is a bit of a coward but has great instincts and a good knowledge of how the organisation works, set out to find the Team Rocket, hidden in this part of the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout their journey, players will be faced with choices that could lead to Team Rocket's rise or fall in the region.
							Yes, the player does not have to be a good person in this part of the game.
						</p>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/img_mainQ_research.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							In the quest line of exploration and research, the player will be doing his job as a young researcher at Nishitsu University.
							The player will work with Louise or Anthony (depending on the gender chosen by the player at the start of the game), and other researchers.
							It takes players on a journey through excavation sites, mysteries and stories about Pokémon. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							Although I do not want to give too many details about these quests to avoid spoiling the reader, I can say what they will not be.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Clarris is not related to any powerful family, gym leader or league champion.</li>
							<li>Patrick has no connection with Team Rocket or any of its leaders.</li>
							<li>Team Rocket is not on its way to destroy the world for no reason.</li>
							<li>Players will not encounter any legendary Pokémon during the exploration and research main quest line.
								Pokémon lore has a lot more to offer than just the Legendaries.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							As you have probably already realised, we have tried, as far as possible, to avoid any obvious, glitzy Hollywood twists when writing the scripts.

							<h2>The HM and TM System</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							Hidden Machines (HM) and Technical Machines (TM) are moves that Pokémon can learn from an object. 
							The difference between the two is that an HM provides a move that gives Pokémons special abilities in the overworld, such as cutting down trees, moving rocks or surfing on water.
							On the other hand, a TM generally only provides a move in combat, which is useless in the overworld.
						</p>
						<p>
							When it comes to TM, there are two ways it has been historically handled in Pokémon games:
							TM are either lost after use (the method used in the early Pokémon games) or can be used indefinitely once found (the method used in some of the later Pokémon games).
							While we found that making a TM single use only had few advantages (giving them more value, increasing the strategic aspect of the game), it is something that was only adapted to the first games in the franchise.
							The reason for this was that Pokémon were few in number at the time, and having only one copy of a TM in the game was manageable. 
							The others can be bought in shops and only involve a small amount of money to be grinded.
							However, in more recent games, with the growing number of Pokémon, the player needs more of these TM. 
							A single-use TM mechanism is now too punitive and goes against the desire to encourage players to play different Pokémons during the same run.
							For those that can be bought, the grind for money is now imposed on the player and is not very much fun.
							For these reasons, we have chosen to allow the TM to be used indefinitely once it has been found.
						</p>
						<p>
							We saw many benefits, as well as addressing the issues raised above.
							Firstly, we can scatter what is 200 TM at this stage all over the map, encouraging the player to explore it.
							Secondly, the strategic aspect of TM, although modified, is still present and now allows for easier experimentation.
							Thirdly, it seems more logical to us: once the player knows how to teach a move, they know it, period.
						</p>
						<p>
							The same applies to relearning moves.
							In many Pokémon games, players have to go through important grind to relearn a single move that their Pokémon used to know.
							For this feature, we have also decided to opt for a version of the latest Pokémon games that allows players to relearn a move without having to pay.
						</p>
						<p>
							When it comes to managing HM in Pokémon games, a few possibilities have been tried out over the years.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The first was that you had to have a Pokémon in your team that knew the HM move to be able to use it in the field (for example, Pokémon Yellow, Blue, Red...).
								HMs are generally weak moves in battle. 
								The fact that you need them in your move pool was already limiting the player, who can only have four moves per Pokémon and six Pokémons in their team.
								Moreover, not all Pokémon can learn the eight to ten HM moves needed to progress with ease in the environment.
								The resulting problem was that the player generally ended up with two or three "HM slave" Pokémon in their team, whose sole purpose was to hold HMs. 
								The only other alternative was that the player had to return to the nearest town each time an HM was required to retrieve the appropriate Pokémon.
							</li>
							<li>
								The second way to remedy this was to use specific items that performed the same overall action as HMs (for example, Pokémon Sword and Shield).
								As a result, there were no more "HM slave" Pokémon.
								The main drawback, however, was that it reduced the connection between the player and their pokémons and immersion in the pokémon world.
								This was particularly true of abilities such as "surf" and "fly", which allow players to ride their Pokémon.
							</li>
							<li>
								The third method was to give the player access to a Pokémon HM (for example, Pokémon Moon, Sun and Legend Arceus).
								Once again, the link with your Pokémons was missing. 
								HM Pokémon are usually loaned to you, and are not your Pokémon as such.
								Their introduction into your story seemed at best forced to introduce the mechanism and raised few questions about how such a system was manageable.
								A Pokémon that appears when you need it is laughable.
								I imagined eight HM pokémon following me, waiting in the bushes behind me until they were needed.
								And what happened when someone else needed their help at the other end of the map? Or was the player once again the chosen one?
								It was not my favourite, that is for sure.
							</li>
							<li>
								Finally, the last was a mixture of the second and third methods (for example, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
								The way this was done was to give you a legendary Pokémon at the start of the game (so yes, a Pokémon), which could not be used to battle (which made it feel like an item), but only to move around the map while using HM abilities (so you ride your Pokémon, which is still cool).
								This is an nice attempt to correct most of the shortcomings of the previous methods.
								However, I found it a little "meh". What do I mean by that?
								First of all, a Legendary... can we please stop this? 
								(It is not really a Legendary in the strict sense of the lore, but it has Legendary-like stats and was on the cover of the associated game, which is usually the signature Legendary Pokémon of the game in question).
								This was neither necessary nor a good choice in my opinion. 
								What made Legendaries legendary in the early games was the difficulty of obtaining them. 
								Remember receiving Mewtwo as a gift at the start of the game for no reason at all? Or finding Articuno or Suicune on the first road and catching them with ease?
								No, they were extremely difficult to catch, hidden away with very little information about their location, and capturing them was not even part of the main story: relentless exploration was the only way to find them.
								It is, however, a pretty interesting attempt to get the player to get attached to the HM Pokémon by giving it to them at the start of the game, and is, in my opinion, the best attempt out of the three to rework the HM function.
								However, the fact that this HM Pokémon could not fight until the end of the game made it forgettable. 
								Honestly, I did not get attached to it at all, and even forgot that it was a Pokémon that I always had with me instead of just a bike.
								Another drawback was that you had to ride this Pokémon and no other.
								Having introduced the riding function as it was presented in Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, I think it's hard to go back: let the player ride the Pokémon they want.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							None of these methods of implementing HM satisfied us.
							There is nothing quite like surfing on your own Pokémon: who has not wanted to ride across the ocean on the back of their Lapras like Ash did in the Pokémon anime?
							Riding a Lapras or Gyarados, or any other Pokémon on water, is one of the role-playing elements that have made the Pokémon games so popular.  
							We wanted players to feel like they were progressing through the world with their Pokémon, without any restrictions.
							This is most likely what the developer of the Pokémon games franchise has been trying to achieve over the years with these various reworks of the HM mechanism.
							That is why we decided to create our own way of managing HM :
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								HM abilities should be held by the player's Pokémons, as was the case in the early games (for example, Pokémon Yellow, Blue, Red...), which means you need HM on one of the Pokémon in your team.
							</li>
							<li>
								In order not to restrict the player's moves set, the Pokémon does not have to have the HM move in its moves set (it can, but does not have to).
								The only condition is that the Pokémon have the corresponding HM move in its learnable moves set. 
								Many Pokémon can learn different HM, but players are generally not keen on the idea of burning up moves for such HM on their favourite Pokémon.
								From now on, they will not have to, as all they need to do is have the Pokémon in their group.
							</li>
							<li>
								However, to be able to use the move in the overworld, the Pokémon will need to have learned how to use the overwold ability from a specialised character in the game.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							It is to be hoped that this will solve most of the problems posed by the old methods, while keeping the bond between the player and his Pokémons intact. 
							This may still limit the player's choice of Pokémon to take with them on their travels, but it feels like a good compromise for now.
							Ultimately, if you want to be able to travel the ocean with your Pokémon, it just make sense that you need to have one in your team that can do it.
							In the same spirit, and to increase immersion, we have changed the pool of Pokémon that can use the overworld "surf" and "fly" abilities.
							We limited the number of Pokémon with such abilities to those that are large enough to carry a person with ease.
							We have always found it ridiculous that a tiny Pidgey could fly the player across the map. 
							Imagining poor Pidgey painfully dragging the player and barely lifting him up is quite funny, but not realistic.
							We've therefore decided to change the pool of Pokémon capable of doing such a thing when it comes to overworld abilities (not in the battle move set, Pidgey can still learn "fly" but will not be able to fly the player).
						</p>
						<p>
							To implement these functions, we drew from the "Improved Field Skills" plugin by Lucidious89 that we modified and tuned to our liking.
							We also added the "Overworld Rock Climb EX" by Ulithium_Dragon, zingzags and DarrylBD99 to add the "rock climb" ability to the pool of HM.
							We added ourself the "whirlpool" ability to the pool of HM.

							<h2>General Style</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Before delving into the arts we have developed for this game, I need to talk about a few of the game's specifications: 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The resolution of the game is 512x384 pixels. </li>
							<li>The sprites and artworks have a 2-pixels unit, which means that what appears to be a pixel on the screen is in fact a 2x2 pixel square.</li>
						</ul>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/gif_style.gif" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							It is this pixel unit that gives the  game its GameBoy Advance old-fashioned look. 
							Because we want to keep this look for the game, we have made sure that all the items and sprites in the game respect this 2-pixels unit.
							However, such a unit results in a rather crude and angular user interface (UI). 
							We therefore decided to use a 1-pixel unit for the UIs to modernise them somewhat.
						</p>
						<p>
							We mainly use a simple software programme, "paint.net", to create all the artworks presented in this section.
						</p>
						<br>

							<h2>The World Map Design</h2>
						</header>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/mapRegion2.png" alt="" /></a>
						<p>
							For the world map interface, we have opted for a Pokémon HeartGold/SoulSilver style, which we feel perfectly embodies the atmosphere of the Pokémon games on Gameboy Advance and early Nintendo DS.
							It is simple and easy to read, but also stylish and pleasing to the eye.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is not much else to say here. 
							It took few days to get the design right, but in the end we are pretty happy with the result.
						</p>

						<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
						<header id="therecipebookui" class="style1">
							<h2>The Recipe Book UI</h2>
						</header>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/recepibook_ui.gif" alt="" /></a>
						<p> 
							To achieve this, the UI wanted it to be a notebook in which players would write down the recipes they received.
							In this case, we have taken inspiration from the style of the Pokédex in Pokémon Legend Arceus.
							We thought this UI was quite effective and matched the style we were looking for.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have redesigned the UI (top left gif) to match the screen resolution and theme of the game.
							The UI has been coded and designed largely from scratch, but uses small pieces of code taken from the "Modular Pause Menu" plugin by Luka S.J. and A.I.R, mainly for reasons of consistency across the various UI codes.
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							The aim of The Recipe Book interface is to provide quick access to the recipes that the player knows.
							To ensure that this interface is effective, we have taken care to provide access to a range of information so that players can gather ressources and craft items efficiently:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>All necessary ingredients.</li>
							<li>The number of each ingredient required.</li>
							<li>The number available in the player's bag.</li>
							<li>A description of the corresponding craftable item.</li>
						</ul>
						<a  class="image left"><img src="images/Pokemon/meal_ui-pic.png" alt="" /></a>

						<p>
							In the same style, we have created a UI for meal preparation (image bottom left), which mainly involves choosing the berries the player wants in their meal.
							I refer you to <a href="#thecraftingandrecipesystem" class="nobr">The Crafting and Recipe System</a> feature if you are interested in the mechanics behind meals.
						</p>
						<p>
							This UI feels a bit to much packed to my taste. 
							However, there is a lot of information that the player needs to easily prepare a meal.
							We wanted this feature to enhance the gaming experience and be as intuitive to use as possible.
							All in all, we are fairly satisfied with the result.
						</p>
						<p>
							We decided to have just 5 (by adding 1 to 5 berries to the pot) so that players can instinctively cook the meal they need, rather than spending several minutes looking for the right recipe from over 100 (as in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if the player needs to recover some HP and revive one Pokémon, all they have to do is browse through the available berries and choose the ones that will enable them to achieve just that.
							This way, the player only has to do a minimum of thinking, just knowing what they need out of the meal is already enough.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this user interface, we have taken care to include all the information the player needs to prepare the meal they require (from top to bottom):
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The number of berries needed for this meal.</li>
							<li>Berries already selected.</li>
							<li>For each meal statistic (HP recovered, PP recovered, status effects healed, and Pokémon resurrected):</li>
							<ul>
								<li>The current statistic, in dark blue for the progress bar and side text.</li>
								<li>The expected stastatistictus if you choose the berry currently highlighted, in light blue for the progress bar and side text.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>For the current highlighted berry:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>The number of berries of this type in the player's bag.</li>
								<li>Statistical values for the berry in each category.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<ul class="actions">
							<li><a href="#summary" class="button style1">Back to summary</a></li>
