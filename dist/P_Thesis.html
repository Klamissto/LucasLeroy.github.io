									<p>
										Key questions in astrophysics are how galaxies develop over time and what drives their evolution. 
										At present, many questions remain unanswered: How many stars form at the very beginning of the Universe, i.e. at a high redshift (i.e. z&ge;4)? 
										What type of galaxy contributes most to the density of star formation in the cosmos? 
										Are they predominantly massive, bright in the infrared (IR), or none of these? 
										What is responsible for the cosmic noon (i.e. when the number of stars formed per unit of comoving volume peaks at z&asymp;2)? 
										Are galaxies always as efficient at transforming gas into stars? How are the properties of galaxies related to each other? 
										How did massive galaxies form so early in the universe?
									</p>
									<p>
										Over the last decade or so, the scientific community has succeeded in carrying out deep surveys of galaxies in fields ranging from the ultraviolet to the millimetre. 
										In 2009, the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) collaboration originally set out to make the deepest observations using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) new cameras: WFC3 (Wide Field Camera 3) in the near infrared and ACS (Advanced Camera for Surveys) in the visible. 
										The CANDELS fields remain the deepest large fields studied to date. 
										They have been observed by numerous telescopes, notably by Herschel in the far infrared (FIR). 
										These fields are now covered in a wide range of wavelengths from the ultraviolet (UV) to the millimetre. 
										The specific features of these fields make them exceptionally well suited to a study aimed at probing the global properties of galaxy evolution down to high redshifts. 
										In addition, via the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the GOODS-ALMA programme has recently enabled the community to benefit from the observation of a CANDELS deep field in the millimetre range. 
										All of this will enable us to improve our understanding of galaxy evolution at higher redshifts and to probe galaxies with even lower stellar mass.
									</p>
									<p>
										This thesis is based on the study of galaxies in these fields. 
										I am combining, for the first time, the deepest surveys Herschel (GOODS-South, GOODS-North, COSMOS and USD) and ALMA (GOODS-South). 
										The aim of the study I carried out during my PhD was to obtain a global view of the cosmic history of star formation. 
										In particular, I constrained the star formation rate (SFR), dust mass (Mdust), dust temperature (Tdust) and gas mass (Mgas) as a function of their Mstar using coherent analysis. 
										This work is made possible by access to the latest versions of galaxy catalogues in the CANDELS fields, as well as by the GOODS-ALMA programme, which extends the study of galaxies to the millimetre range.
									</p>
									<p>
										An important part of my PhD involved using an image stacking method in the FIR. 
										The image stacking method consists of stacking the photometric images, from a single band, of several galaxies in order to increase the signal to noise ratio (S/N) on this population. 
										The aim is to deduce the characteristic flux density of a population of galaxies that could not be detected individually.  
										To this end, I have studied the stacking method and its biases in depth. 
										In particular, I am interested in the clustering bias that appears in the Herschel bands when galaxies are stacked together. 
										I compare two methods that aim to cancel this bias. 
										I also compare different methods of fitting the spectral energy distribution and study their potential biases. 
									</p>

									<p>
										By performing this stacking analysis on more than 105,000 galaxies selected from HST $H$-band, I recover the evolution, from $z=5$ to z=0, of key properties of star-forming galaxies (SFG) such as their SFR, Tdust and Mgas. 
										Throughout the study, I am also interested in H-dropout galaxies that are not taken into account in the initial sample.  
										I deduce the relative contribution of galaxies to the cosmic history of star formation as a function of Mstar and compare it with the TNG100 simulation. 
										I study the evolution of galaxies in the SigSFR - Siggas plane as a function of redshift and Mstar.
									</p>

									<p>
										With this study, I show that ALMA is a useful complement to a study based solely on Herschel by making it possible to reach lower Mstar and higher redshifts. 
										I confirm that the main sequence of star formation follows a linear evolution with a slope close to unity, and that a curvature appears at high masses at z&le;2. 
										I confirm that the mean Tdust of the main sequence galaxies evolves linearly with redshift, with no apparent correlation with Mstar.
									</p>

									<p>
										Furthermore, I have shown that, up to z=5, the most massive galaxies (i.e. <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>⋆</sub> ≥ 10<sup>10</sup> <em>M</em><sub>⊙</sub></span>) contribute most to the total SFR density (rhoSFR), while the sum of stars formed by the least massive galaxies (i.e. <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>⋆</sub> ≤ 10<sup>10</sup> <em>M</em><sub>⊙</sub></span>) is rather constant. 
										The TNG100 cosmological simulation does not reproduce the relative contribution of galaxies to the rhoSFR as a function of Mstar. 
										I give, for the first time, an estimate of the contribution of H-dropout galaxies to the rhoSFR of galaxies of similar stellar mass: at z&asymp;5$, H-dropout galaxies account for &asymp;23% of the stars formed in massive galaxies (i.e., <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>⋆</sub> ≥ 10<sup>10.3</sup> <em>M</em><sub>⊙</sub></span>). 
										Finally, I present evidence that high-redshift galaxies, compared to low-redshift galaxies, are intrinsically more efficient for star formation, compared to what is expected from the local Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.
