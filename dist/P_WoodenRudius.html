										So I carved a Rudius... 
									</p>
									<p>	
										I started this project out of the blue when I was finishing writting my PhD manuscript in early July 2023.
										To be honest, I simply needed something to get my mind off my PhD manuscript. 
										Therefore, one week end I though that I needed a manual project with minimum thinking and a great dose of manual work.
										I am also quite fon of antiquity and old civilizations, and the Roman Empire is one of my favorite one since I can remember as a kid.
										Fun fact, I seriously considered a carrier in Archeology or History in Ancient civilization, but when you are good at Maths in France usually go for Maths.
										Anyway, that week end was the precise moment when I remembered that I would litteraly kill to have a cool wooden Roman sword when I was a kid.
									</p>
									<p>
										So here you go, I carved a Rudius out of wood. 
										A Rudius is a wooden Gladius which used to be given to Gladiators in Ancient Rome when they won their freedom. It could also have been used a training weapon. 
										As I said the purpose was really to get my mind off writting my dissertation so I decided to do it without any electrical tools. 
										This little detail made it harder but that is what made this project great for me.
										This project lasted a week, with 4 days dedicated to the actual carving and assembling of the Rudius.
										Unfortunatly, I did not though about taking pictures of the ongoing project at the time (the Bass Guitar project was the exception not the rule) as I was not expecting talking about it in some future web site port folio.

										<h2>The Preparation</h2>
									</header>
								<a class="image left"><img src="images/Rudius/Gladius Templates-1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									The first step was to gather a set of 1:1 scale templates of the Rudius. 
									I considered drawing the template myself, but again I was really looking for some manual rather than creative work.
									Thus, I just pick templates online close to what I had in mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									The second step is to gather tools and materials. 
									In this case, this was quite simple: I uncover some old tools from my grampa long lost in my garage, and went to the local hardware store and picked a planck of wood.
									I did not know which kind of wood I picked, but I would look into it more if I was to do it again. 
									Not that the choice was bad, but I would be interrested to get to know which one would habe been the best for this project. 
								</p>
								<header id="thegamelogoandgameicon" class="style1">
									<h2>Carving the pieces</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Anyway, here I am, ready to start.
									The first step of making the sword was to cut the planck into appropiate pieces: the blade, the grip, the guard and the pommel. 
									I had to glue together two parts of the planck to made wood piece thick enought for the pommel, the grip and the guard.
								</p>
								
								<a class="image left"><img src="images/Rudius/Gladius Templates-3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									Then I started carving indivual pieces. I started by removing large parts of wood to obtain a rougth shape using a large knife and a saw.
									Next, I chiselled pieces for closer carving. Finally, I use some small finishing carving tools and sanding paper for the last details.
								</p>
								<p>
									The way it works, as you can see on this illustration, is that the blade have to go through the guard, the grip and the pommel so that everything stay together.
									Therefore, I needed to make a hole into both the grip and the guard. 
									The grip was by far the hardest part of this project and took me few hours of long carving to make a strait hole just large enought to fit the extension of the blade.
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<header id="thegamelogoandgameicon" class="style1">
									<h2>Finishing and Assembling</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Once all the pieces were ready, I corect few of mistakes and natural holes of the woods with some wodd filler.
									Then I varnished all pieces. Once they were dry, I slotted them together and glued them.
								</p>
								<header id="thegamelogoandgameicon" class="style1">
									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									And here you go, this was a nice quick project. My main draw back on this one was that I did not prepared the project enought.
									For example, if I was to do it again (and I probably will), I wood look more into the right kind woods to use. 
									I would make sure I have proper equipments to confortably carve: I used a knife for smoothing down the planck, I had an old wobbly table as a carpenter bench and a small vice attachec to it.
									And I would get some new varnish: for this project I picked two old varnish in the garage that was there for god know how long. 
									One was supposed to be much brighter than the other (for the grip, guard and pommel parts), but ultimatle look exactly as the other one.
									Then I would also give me more time to detail the handle and the overall finishing: I was a bit in a rush because I only had a week to finish everything in my schedule, and had to go back writting my manuscrip right after.
								</p>
								<p>
									So yes, I could have, without a doubt, done a better job at it. However, this project went perfectly for its original purpose: I cleared my mind, finished my manuscript and now I have a PhD in Astrophysics (and a Rudius) because of it. 
									Jokes aside, the whole carving process was a lots of fun and this is definitively something that I will do again, especially the part where I am not using electrical tools.
