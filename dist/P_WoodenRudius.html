									<p>
										So I carved a Rudius... 
									</p>
									<p>	
										I launched this project out of the blue just as I was finishing writing the manuscript for my PhD, at the beginning of July 2023.
										To be honest, I simply needed to take my mind off my PhD manuscript. 
										That is why, one weekend, I said to myself that I needed a manual project with a minimum of thought and a good dose of manual work.
										I also love antiquity and ancient civilisations, and the Roman Empire has been one of my favourites ever since I can remember being a child.
										Funnily enough, I seriously considered a career in archaeology or the history of ancient civilisation, but when you're good at maths in France, you generally go for maths.
										Anyway, this weekend was the precise moment when I remembered that I would have literally killed to have a wooden Roman sword when I was a kid.
									</p>
									<p>
										So here we are, I have carved a Rudius out of wood. 
										A Rudius is a wooden Gladius which used to be given to Gladiators in Ancient Rome when they won their freedom. It could also have been used a training weapon. 
										As I said, the aim was to take my mind off writing my dissertation. Thus, I decided to do it without power tools. 
										This little detail made the task more difficult, but that is what made this project great for me.
										The project lasted a week, with four days devoted to carving and assembling the Rudius.
										Unfortunately, I did not think to take any photos of the project in progress at the time (the Bass Guitar project was the exception and not the rule) because I did not expect to talk about it in a future port folio on a website.

										<h2>The Preparation</h2>
									</header>
								<a class="image left"><img src="images/Rudius/Gladius Templates-1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									The first step was to assemble a set of 1:1 scale models of the Rudius. 
									I considered drawing the model myself, but again, I was looking for manual rather than creative work.
									Thus, I just choose models online that are close to what I had in mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									The second step is to gather the tools and materials. 
									In this case, it was very simple: I found some of my grandfather's long-lost tools in my garage, and went to the local hardware store to pick out a plank of wood.
									I didn't know what type of wood I had chosen, but I would take a mind it if I had to do it again. 
									Not that the choice was a bad one, but I would be interested to know which would have been the best for this project. 
								</p>
								<br>

								<header id="thegamelogoandgameicon" class="style1">
									<h2>Carving the pieces</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Anyway, I am ready to get started.
									The first step in making the sword was to cut the planck into appropriate pieces: the blade, the grip, the guard and the pommel. 
									I had to glue two parts of the planck together to obtain a piece of wood thick enough for the pommel, grip and guard.
								</p>
								
								<a class="image left"><img src="images/Rudius/Gladius Templates-3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									I then started carving individual pieces. I started by removing large sections of wood to obtain a rough shape using a large knife and a saw.
									Then I chiselled some pieces to sculpt them more closely. Finally, I use small finishing tools and sandpaper for the final details.
								</p>
								<p>
									As you can see from this illustration, the blade must pass through the guard, the grip and the pommel for everything to stay together.
									Therefore, I had to cut a hole in the handle and in the protection. 
									The handle was by far the most difficult part of this project and took me several hours of painstaking carving to make a straight hole just big enough to fit the blade extension.
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<header id="thegamelogoandgameicon" class="style1">
									<h2>Finishing and Assembling</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Once all the pieces were ready, I corrected a few mistakes and natural holes in the wood with some wood filler.
									I then varnished all the pieces. Once they were dry, I fitted them together and glued them.
								</p>
								<header id="thegamelogoandgameicon" class="style1">
									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									And there you have it, it was a quick and fun project. My main drawback is that I did not prepare the project enough.
									For example, if I were to do it again (and I probably will), I would take a closer look at the type of wood to use. 
									I would make sure I had the right equipment to carve comfortably: I used a knife to smooth the planck, I had an old wobbly table as a carpenter's bench and a small vice attached to it.
									And I would get new varnishes. For this project, I got two old varnishes from the garage that had been there for who knows how long. 
									One was supposed to be much lighter than the other (for the grip, guard and pommel parts), but in the end it looks exactly the same (somehow).
									I would also give more time to detail the handle and general finish. 
									I was in a bit of a hurry because I only had a week of break to finish everything, and I had to get back to writing my manuscript right after.
								</p>
								<p>
									So yes, there is no doubt that I could have done better. 
									However, this project achieved its initial objective perfectly: I freed my mind, finished my manuscript and now have a PhD in astrophysics (and a Rudius) thanks to it. 
									All joking aside, the whole sculpting process was a lot of fun and it is definitely something I will be doing again, especially the part where I do not use power tools.
